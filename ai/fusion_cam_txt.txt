Part 1 –  
Implementing Turning 
Operations in Fusion 360
In this first part, we will approach a lathe and its most common turning operations, trying to fully 
understand the potential and main limitations of this particular type of manufacturing process. After 
diving straight into turning equations and the underlying theory, we will implement a set of turning 
strategies to fully machine a simple part. In addition, we will cover important topics such as the tool 
library and custom tools.
This part includes the following chapters:
• Chapter 1 , Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools
• Chapter 2 , Handling Part Setup for Turning
• Chapter 3 , Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools
• Chapter 4 , Implementing Our First Turning Operation
• Chapter 5 , Discovering More Turning Strategies1
Getting Started with Turning 
and Its Tools
Moving from 3D computer-aided design  (CAD ) models to manufactured parts may look like a giant 
leap difficult to overcome. In reality, it is not something to be scared of, and in the following pages 
of this book, we will try to explain step by step all the major challenges to overcome. In the end, you 
should have gained more confidence with machining and the manufacturing world in general.
In this chapter, we will approach a lathe for the first time, exploring components, terminology, and 
best practices without relying on prior knowledge.
The goal of this chapter is to let you familiarize yourself with the theory before approaching real 
case scenarios. Although you may want to start spinning your chuck immediately, a dive into basic 
concepts is very important; after all, behind every successfully machined part, however complex it 
may be, there is always the fundamental underlying theory.
We will also discuss turning, reaching a general understanding of what is possible and what is not 
possible with this method. This type of knowledge is fundamental to unleash turning's potential, 
instead of trying to copy and paste provided examples into your machining scenario.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Approaching a lathe and its components
• Understanding the main parameters
• Exploring main machining strategies
• Understanding tool geometryGetting Started with Turning and Its Tools 4
Technical requirements
There are no technical requirements for this chapter; however, just in case you have tools and inserts 
floating around the room, you may want to collect them in order to observe them as you read.
Approaching a lathe and its components
Turning , long story short, it is a very old machining technique discovered thousands of years ago. 
While understanding Egyptian pottery may sound interesting to some, it is definitely out of the scope 
of this book, so we are going to jump right into the action!
Turning is a mechanical process where a cylindrical part is put on fast rotation, and then approached 
by a cutting tool that progressively removes material from it. The machine that lets us shape our part 
with this technique is called a lathe .
If you ask a professional CNC user, they will tell you that a lathe is a rather complex machine that 
consists of many components such as the saddle, the tailstock, the headstock, and so on. Don’t worry 
about all these intimidating words—we will approach turning in the simplest way possible. In the 
following screenshot, we can find a lathe stripped up to the bones:
Figure 1.1: Lathe main actors
Ultimately, there are only four actors involved in turning:
1. Chuck : A fast-spinning clamping device; it holds the stock to be machined
2. Cutting tool : A special hard-metal blade that removes material from the stock
3. Machined stock : Our part before machining is completed
4. Chip : The removed particles and filament (waste material)
Approaching a lathe and its components
 5
If you have ever approached a working lathe, I’m sure you noticed that the material shape about to be 
machined—the stock—spins very fast, while the cutting tool moves quite slowly, with a lot of chips 
being generated and projected all over the surrounding environment.
Even if the chip is valueless, it doesn’t mean that we can pretend it doesn’t exist; if we did, it would 
very easily render our part and our tool valueless. Controlling chip formation is very important (not 
only for turning) because it has the bad habit of becoming an entangled mess (a little bit like pasta) 
and damages everything it comes into contact with.
There are several types of lathes on the market; some are really big and some are very complex, but 
at the end of the day, all of them are pretty similar to one another.
Now that we understand the main components of the lathe, we can dive just a little bit into the theory 
behind such an incredible machine!
Cylindrical coordinate system
In order to understand coordinates, we need to remember that we live in a 3D world. In our world, in 
order to specify the location of an object with exact precision, we must provide a set of three numbers 
(coordinates) that measure the distance from a point in space—the origin—in a given direction.
In our daily lives, we often use Cartesian coordinates ; here, we have a few examples:
• When working in an Excel file or when playing Battleship , in order to locate a cell, we need to 
know the row number and column number (2D Cartesian coordinates)
• If we want to give the dimensions of an object, we must provide the length, the width, and the 
height (3D Cartesian coordinates)
However, as mentioned, all the examples previously listed are Cartesian coordinates, where coordinates 
are expressed as a length along axes oriented at 90° from each other.
Orienting all the axes at 90° is generally the best approach for parts with a cubic shape, however, when 
it comes to lathes, a different coordinate system may be better. This is because all parts machined with 
a lathe have an axial symmetry, meaning that basically every part looks more or less like a cylinder. 
Therefore, we can use cylindrical coordinates  instead.
With cylindrical coordinates, we do not express a point position with three distances; we express  
a position with an angle and two distances. We can see this in the following screenshot:Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 6
Figure 1.2: Cylindrical coordinates’ components
Let’s specify what the labels mean:
1. The red arrow is the axial direction (longitudinal), which is the rotation axis.
2. The yellow arrow is the rotation angle ( 𝛼𝛼 ).
3. The green arrow is the radial direction. Note that the arrow is not static; you can pretend it is 
a hand of a clock, where all the ticks on the dial would be a possible radial direction. There are 
infinite green arrows around the rotation axis, each rotated by an angle ( 𝛼𝛼 ) from 0° to 360°!
With these three numbers, we already can specify with extreme precision every single point 
inside and outside our stock. However, it will be useful to introduce another direction.
4. The blue arrow is the tangential direction. It may not be so simple to understand the tangential 
direction, but we can just say that it is a vector that starts from the tip of a radial vector with a 
direction perpendicular both to the radial vector and to the axial vector.
Now that we know a bit more about cylindrical coordinates, we can start using this knowledge to 
differentiate between turning operations!
Different types of turning operations
To discuss the different types of turning operations, we will look at the two main families of machining:
• External machining
• Internal machining
Let’s take a look at these in more detail.
Approaching a lathe and its components
 7
External machining
These operations are the most  common operations performed while turning. In this type of process, 
the material is removed from “outside-in” along the radial direction. This basically means that the 
average radial coordinate of our tool will keep reducing during the operation.
In the following screenshot, we have a typical external machining operation depicted:
Figure 1.3: External machining example
Just by glancing at the figure, we should understand that the tool starts on the outside of our part 
where the radial coordinate is at the maximum, while machining it will progressively reduce it when 
moving toward the center (where the radial coordinate is 0).
Since, as we will discover, there are many different types of machining strategies, it is a bit difficult to 
find a strict definition for external machining; however, everything will be clearer when compared 
to the next machining approach.
Internal machining
These operations are  different from the previous case since the material is removed “inside-out. ” So, 
the average radial coordinate for our tool is growing during the operation:
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 8
Figure 1.4: Internal machining example
As you can see from the previous screenshot, the tool is moving inside our stock, and the cut chip may 
find itself stuck in the cavity since there is material all around the tool. As you can also see, the tool 
is still quite visible, but there are cases where we may completely lose the line of sight after a certain 
depth, and this is not good for beginners.
As a matter of fact, when we first approach turning, it is always a good idea to look constantly at our 
part while being machined since we can check the surface finish, prevent unforeseen collisions with 
parts of the stock or parts of the lathe, and monitor chip evacuation. For all these reasons, internal 
machining may be a bit trickier than external machining.
Note
As a rule of thumb, if the forming chip is somehow free to flow and falls on the ground, we are 
in external machining; if it can be stuck inside, we are in internal machining.
It is now time to explore something a bit more technical but really important to understand: 
working parameters!
Understanding the main parameters
It is now time to talk about the parameters involved in our turning operations. First of all, what is  
a parameter? In short, a  parameter is a value or a setting that we can change.
Of course, some parameters are easier to change than others. For example, changing the axial movement 
speed for our tool is very simple, while on the other hand, changing the maximum cutting power may 
require a bigger and more powerful lathe.
Understanding the main parameters
 9
Also, as we will shortly discover, some values are somehow connected to others; changing one parameter 
may change one or more others, so we have to optimize parameters according to our lathe specs and 
to the part we want to machine.
Let’s find out what the main parameters are that we have to work with.
Turning speed
The turning speed  is a measure of how fast the chuck is spinning; it may be  measured in radians per 
time unit (𝛼𝛼̇ ) or in revolutions per time unit ( n ).
As shown in the screenshot, the bent vector represents the part spinning along the longitudinal axis:
Figure 1.5: Turning-speed visualization
One revolution of our chuck corresponds to an angle ( 𝛼𝛼 ) of 360° or 2𝜋𝜋  (depending on whether it’s 
measured in degrees or radians). But, since n  is measured in revolution per time unit, we need to 
divide the  angle by the same time unit, so that from the angle, we get angular speed ( 𝛼𝛼̇ ).
In short, we just need to remember this formula:
Old lathes had turning speeds that were only adjustable by manually changing the belt and pulleys, 
or changing the gears. Today, there are lathes that can control the rotation speed with inverters and 
encoders. So, depending on your lathe, the turning speed may or may not be a parameter that's easy 
to change.
Note
Please be careful when dealing with time units: sometimes the time unit may be seconds and 
sometimes minutes. As you can imagine, one revolution per minute is very different from one 
revolution per second, so when using any formula, please always be sure of its units!
𝛼𝛼̇=2𝜋𝜋n Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 10
Cutting speed
The cutting speed  (𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐 ) is the  relative speed between our cutting tool and the surface it  is cutting. 
There is only one important thing to notice, which is that the cutting speed is highly dependent on the 
radial position of our tool: the bigger the diameter means the higher the cutting speed (at a constant 
rotation speed).
As you can see in the screenshot, we have a common rotation speed for the two tools (since the chuck 
rotation is always the same); however, as you may have noticed from the different arrow lengths, the 
tool that is machining a bigger diameter has a much higher cutting speed (vertical vector) than the 
tool machining a smaller diameter:
Figure 1.6: Cutting-speed visualization
Note
A vector can be defined by a magnitude and a direction. Magnitude is represented by the arrow 
length, while the direction is represented by the direction of the pointed tip.
Cutting  speed is typically measured in meters per minute  (m/min ), and  there is a very simple formula 
for calculating it:
Here, 𝐷𝐷  is the  diameter in millimeters  (mm) and 𝑛𝑛  is revolutions per minute  (RPM ).
For example, let’s imagine we have a chuck rotating at 500 RPM, and we are performing a longitudinal 
operation at a constant radial distance of 50 mm (basically, we are machining a stock with a diameter 
of 100 mm). What is the cutting speed seen by our tool? It's very simple:
𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐=𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋
1000 
𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐=𝜋𝜋∗500  [𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ]∗100  [𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ]
1000=157  𝑟𝑟/𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  Understanding the main parameters
 11
Now that we have seen the cutting-speed formula, it should be now clear that when machining a shape 
with different radial coordinates assumed by our tool, the cutting speed will be subject to changes. 
Since the working diameter is not a parameter we can change (it is related to the part shape we want 
to machine), in order to change the cutting speed, we can only adjust the chuck RPM. That’s why 
most of the time, you will see bigger parts spinning slower and smaller parts spinning faster! Once 
the tool is almost at the rotation axis, the cutting speed will always drop to zero, independently of 
how fast the chuck is rotating.
Cutting depth
The cutting depth  ( ) is a parameter that gives us a measure of how much we impose an interpenetration 
between our tool and our part; it is measured in mm. Basically, it is related to how much of our cutting 
edge is engaged with the stock:
Figure 1.7: Cutting-depth visualization
As we can see, there are two tools machining the same diameter. The one on the left, however, is 
engaging the stock at a very small cutting depth, and therefore it removes only a thin layer of material. 
The tool on the right is cutting at a much bigger cutting depth and therefore it is removing a much 
thicker layer, and most of the cutting edge is engaged.
Please note that cutting depth is not always measured in the radial direction; sometimes, it can be 
measured in the axial direction. It mainly depends on the type of machining process we use (we will 
explain this in the Exploring main machining strategies  section later in the chapter).
Higher cutting depth means more material removed and therefore faster machining, but requires more 
cutting power and leads to higher stress on our tool and our part. For this reason, please consider that 
higher cutting depths may partially bend our stock (especially if it is long and supported on one side 
only). Bending may lead to weird shapes with a rough finish.
Cutting feed
The cutting feed  (𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛 ) is a  parameter that measures how much our tool is advancing along the cutting 
direction at every revolution of our chuck, and therefore it is measured in mm per revolution  (mm/rev )
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 12
Similar to cutting depth, higher feeds lead to higher machining speed at the cost of higher tool wear 
and higher power being required. The part finish is highly connected with feed values; as a rule of 
thumb, a lower feed value means higher surface quality.
In the following screenshot, we have two tools machining the same stock at the same cutting depth:
Figure 1.8: Feed visualization
However, in the first example, there is a much smaller feed step than in the second, so though they 
have the same turning speed, the tool on the bottom will reach the end of the stock much quicker, at 
the cost of higher surface roughness.
Be careful, as certain operations must be performed at a constant feed, such as threading. Threads 
have a constant pitch per rotation; therefore, we must set the feed to be equal to the thread pitch in 
such a scenario.
Note
Threading is the process of making a thread. It may be related to a male thread (such as a screw) 
or a female thread (such as a nut).
Understanding the main parameters
 13
Adjusting the  feed will also affect the chip. We can assume that a lower feed will produce a very 
long and entangled chip, while a higher feed will produce small particles. This is illustrated in the 
following screenshot:
Figure 1.9: Chip formation related to feed
We should always try to hit a sweet spot in chip thickness, width, and length. The ideal chip shape  is 
the one in the middle of the screenshot.
Note
Chip formation is a very interesting world of its own. I don’t really want to distract you from 
the main topic; however, if you want to learn more about chip formation and different chip 
types, I suggest you take a look at this interesting link: https://www.bdeinc.com/
blog/types-of-chips-formed-during-cnc-milling/ .
Cutting power
The cutting power  is the mechanical power required to machine our part at a given set of parameters. 
It is measured  in kilowatts  (kW).
Before setting all our parameters, we must always check whether our lathe is powerful enough to 
handle the machining we want to perform. This is the simple formula to remember:
Here, 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐  is the cutting power measured in kW; 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐  is the cutting speed measured in m/min; 𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝  is the 
cutting depth measured in mm; 𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛  is the feed step measured in mm/rev; and, finally, 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  is the specific 
cutting force measured in MegaPascal (MPa) .
𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐= 𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐∗𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝∗𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛∗𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐
6∗104 Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 14
As you may have noticed, there is a new value called 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  that we haven’t seen yet. 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  is a parameter 
related to material strength, tool shape, feed ratio, and cutting depth. This is a difficult parameter to 
evaluate, and I don’t want to bother you with complex calculations… but luckily, I don’t have to. We 
can simply refer to tables where equations are already sorted out by experts. Please note that this is a 
rough approximation of the real value, so you may want to take it with a grain of salt and have a bit 
of a safety margin on cutting power!
Here, we can find an example of the most common iron alloys:
Material/Feed 0.1 mm/rev 0.2 mm/rev 0.3 mm/rev 0.4 mm/rev 0.6 mm/rev
Cast iron 3200 MPa 2800 MPa 2600 MPa 2500 MPa 2300 MPa
Mild steel 3600 MPa 3100 MPa 2700 MPa 2500 MPa 2300 MPa
Medium steel 3100 MPa 2700 MPa 2600 MPa 2500 MPa 2300 MPa
Hard steel 4050 MPa 3600 MPa 3300 MPa 3000 MPa 2600 MPa
Tool steel 3200 MPa 2900 MPa 2600 MPa 2500 MPa 2400 MPa
Figure 1.10: Kc approximation for steel and iron
Using such a table is quite simple: we simply select the row  according to the material we are about 
to machine, then we select the column with a feed similar to the one we plan to use, and the result 
approximates the real 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  value.
Note
If you are intrigued by this parameter, you can find all the formulas for a precise evaluation of 
𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  here: http://www.mitsubishicarbide.net/contents/mhg/enuk/html/
product/technical_information/information/formula4.html .
As you can see, there is a very useful formula where we can insert our cutting parameters to get 
our 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  value. If you are hungry for more formulas, there is a very good explanation about 𝐾𝐾𝑐𝑐  
here: https://www.machiningdoctor.com/glossary/specific-cutting-
force-kc-kc1/#k1c-and-mc-chart-for-material-group .
With that last equation, it is now easy to understand that all parameters are connected and that we 
must change them accordingly to meet the maximum cutting power available for our lathe.
Y ou may be wondering whether it is a must to target maximum power. No, it is not, but from the 
production point of view, not using our machine at its full potential will cost us more money per hour. 
However, a typical scenario where we will not use maximum cutting power is when we are machining  
a fragile material that we may damage with our chuck closed at maximum force to sustain chuck torque.
Now that we have covered the main parameters, we should better understand our lathe. Next, let’s 
jump into something juicier: turning operations and strategies!Exploring main machining strategies
 15
Exploring main machining strategies
When we plan how to  machine our part out of the stock, we have to think like a chess master. What  
I mean by this is that we have several pieces we can play with, but in order to win the game, we have to 
use every component in the best possible way it can be used. Therefore, we need to plan which piece 
to play first and with which type of move: do we move the bishop or the queen? Do we move by one 
square at a time or full speed ahead?
In the following sections, we are going to discover the main moves we can play with when it comes 
to turning.
Longitudinal operations
Longitudinal machining  is a simple and common operation strategy, suitable for  rough machining 
with high power and strong tools. Let’s check a basic example in the following screenshot:
Figure 1.11: Longitudinal machining approach
The typical approach for longitudinal operations is to move the tool on the front of our stock (at  
a safe distance), set the cutting depth in the radial direction, and then move the tool forward. As we 
can see in the screenshot, while cutting, our tool is moving along the axial direction only, so we have 
a constant cutting speed per cutting pass. Once at the desired distance, the tool will disengage our 
stock radially and then repeat the process until the right diameter is machined.
Since this is longitudinal machining, the main cutting direction is on the longitudinal axis at a given 
radial distance; therefore, after a chuck rotation, our tool will be moved by one feed step along the 
longitudinal direction.
As a recap, in this type of machining, the cutting feed is along the axial direction, while the cutting 
depth is fixed  and constant and is measured along the radial direction. As we are about to discover, 
there are other machining strategies where what we just said doesn’t apply.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 16
Facing operations
Facing  is used when  we need to clean the front face of our stock:
Figure 1.12: Facing machining approach
As shown here, while cutting, our tool is moving in the radial direction only; therefore, the cutting 
power will keep changing unless we adjust the feed or rotation speed accordingly.
The standard approach for facing operations is to move the tool at a safe distance in the radial direction, 
set the cutting depth in the axial direction, and then approach the stock radially. Once at the desired 
position, the tool will disengage our stock axially and then repeat the process until the right length 
is machined.
Since in facing, we are basically cleaning a slice of our stock, we are operating at a fixed axial coordinate 
and our tool is moving radially. So, after a chuck rotation, our tool will be moved forward by one feed 
step along the radial direction.
As a recap, when  facing, the cutting feed is along the radial direction while the cutting depth is along 
the axial direction (this is different than longitudinal operations!).
Plunging operations
Plunging  is similar  to facing since the tool is moving in the radial direction only; however, because 
plunging is used for grooving or cutting, the tool is much slimmer. That’s because circlips grooves can 
be very thin, and our tool needs to fit inside them. Another reason is that when cutting our part, it is 
not a good idea to perform a large cut because that would require a lot of material removed without 
a real need.
As already mentioned for facing, since radial coordinates are always changing, so does the cutting 
power, unless controlled by feed changes or RPM.
Exploring main machining strategies
 17
As shown in the following screenshot, the typical approach for plunging is to position our tool at a 
safe radial position, set the desired axial coordinate, and then approach the part radially:
Figure 1.13: Plunging machining approach
So, to recap this strategy, plunging is similar to facing since it has feed along the radial direction too, 
but the main difference is that we cannot set the cutting depth since the tool cutting edge is  always 
engaged entirely; therefore, the cutting depth is always at the maximum possible value!
Profiling operations
Profiling  is one of the most  complex operations since the tool moves constantly radially and axially. 
Let’s check the following screenshot for an idea of how profiling works:
Figure 1.14: Profiling machining approach
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 18
As shown in the screenshot, the motion path of our tool can be very complex; therefore, this type of 
operation is the most flexible and is well suited for finishing our part. However, due to the fact that 
the cutting direction is not constant, there is always the risk of impact between the tool and our stock. 
As you may have noticed in the screenshot, after “climbing the first hill, ” our tool will likely collide 
with the stock since the required path is too steep for the tool to pass.
To reduce the possibility of errors, an impact simulation is always a good idea in CAM, but for complex 
machining operations such as profiling, you must always check the results. Especially when a beginner 
is approaching turning for the first time, 99% of the time they will discover that the back of the tool 
or the shank will collide where the profile gets too steep or too narrow.
If we want to analyze what happens to our cutting parameters when profiling, we have to remember 
that the profile is not constant along the radial direction nor along the longitudinal direction; it keeps 
changing. So, unless our chuck is able to control rotation according to the tool’s radial position, the 
cutting speed will not be constant.
Having said that, we also need to remember that feed is measured along the cutting direction, so it 
will keep changing along the profile; the same can also be said for cutting depth.
Finally, we are at the end of yet another section. There is only one last major topic to cover: tool geometry.
Understanding tool geometry
As we discovered, there are many possible operations and geometries that we can machine on our 
lathe, but not every tool is suitable for every operation (always remember the chess analogy). We are 
now going to classify tool geometry in order to recognize, at first glance, which tool is more suitable 
for which machining strategy.
We can split the geometry of a cutting tool into three main categories:
• Tool edges
• Tool surfaces
• Tool angles
Let’s start with our deeper analysis of the geometry.
Tool edges
In the following screenshot, we can  see a tool with a transparent shank where the edges are highlighted:Understanding tool geometry
 19
Figure 1.15: Main tool edges highlighted
Y ou’ll notice that the tool shown is very crudely drawn and is simply a square. In reality, as we are 
going to discover, tool geometry is way more complex; however, at the moment, we will pretend it is 
a real tool since understanding surfaces and edges will be simpler this way.
Here are the  three edges:
1. The main cutting edge
2. The auxiliary cutting edge
3. The nose edge
Let’s take a look at them.
Cutting edge
As the name suggests, the cutting edge  is a sharp edge that cuts our stock that is  rotating against it. 
The cutting edge simply cuts along the feed direction and cuts the main portion of the chip.
Auxiliary cutting edge
In order to cut the stock, we  need to cut in two directions. So, the auxiliary cutting edge  cuts  the side 
of the chip and removes the material from the stock.
Nose edge (radius)
The nose edge  is not a real “edge. ” It is never sharp because it wouldn’t last a single second while 
machining; instead, it is a “smooth edge” with a specific radius that can be bigger or smaller according 
to the tool we choose. A tool with a bigger nose radius will be less sharp and therefore will be able to 
sustain higher feed rates and higher cutting depths for a longer time.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 20
Saying that, it is important to note that the nose radius is responsible for the surface’s finish. As you 
can see here, from a geometrical point of view, a higher nose radius will lead to less surface roughness 
when machining, and therefore to a better surface finish:
Figure 1.16: Changing the nose radius will change surface roughness
So, it looks like you may always want to use a large nose radius for roughing and for finishing… well, not 
so fast—there is a catch! When working at a low cutting depth (for example, when finishing a flexible 
part), a big nose radius will generate higher radial forces that are going to create strong vibrations 
(more details on that in the Entering angle (KAPR)  section at the end of this chapter). Such vibrations 
will ruin the surface finish. A tool with a small  nose radius will be super sharp and short-lasting, but 
also incredibly more effective at small cutting depths when finishing.
Now that we have learned something about the three main edges of every tool, let’s now start talking 
about the three main surfaces and their relative orientation.
Tool surfaces
All the edges listed up until now come into contact at the tip (or the nose ) of the part. Three main 
surfaces are defined from this intersection. As always, it is way easier to understand the geometry by 
looking at a simple example:
Understanding tool geometry
 21
Figure 1.17: The main surfaces of a tool
Here, we can see three highlighted surfaces to study:
1. Rake surface
2. Main flank
3. Auxiliary flank
Let’s take a look at them.
Rake surface
The rake surface  is the  surface generated between the main cutting edge and the auxiliary cutting 
edge. It is the surface our chip is rubbing against before being evacuated. As you can imagine, much 
of the cutting power is transmitted to the stock through the cutting edge and the rake surface. At the 
moment, there is not much more to say about it, but as we will shortly discover, the main point of 
interest is its rotation.
Tool flanks
In our tool, we have two flanks:
• The main flank  is generated between our  cutting edge and our nose edge
• The auxiliary flank  is generated between our auxiliary cutting edge and our nose edge
After that quick look at surfaces, let’s analyze angles.
Tool angles
When machining our part, we have  many angles involved; some angles are related to the tool shape, 
while others are related to the way our tool is installed on the lathe.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 22
Rake angle
The rake angle  ( 𝛾𝛾  ) is the  angle that describes how much our rake surface is rotated around the 
cutting edge. We can classify tools according to their rake angle, and we can distinguish three types 
of tool families: negative tools, neutral tools, and positive tools.
In the following screenshot, we can see those three tools, from left to right respectively:
Figure 1.18: Rake angle visualized
More positive values will result in a super sharp tool (with a lower life span) capable of an easy-flowing 
chip very suitable for a surface finish.
More negative values will result in a stronger tool with a higher life span. Since the cutting edge is not 
so sharp, the tool will be great for roughing passes with higher cutting depth. As you can see in the 
screenshot, negative rake angles impose a hard twist in the forming chip; therefore, it won’t flow so 
easily and will break into smaller particles that may  rub against  the machined surface.
There is not much to say about neutral tools—their properties are a mix between positive tools and 
negative tools.
Please note that there is also a less important rake angle measured from the auxiliary cutting edge:
Figure 1.19: Rake angles
In the  screenshot, we can find the main rake angle on the left and the auxiliary rake  angle on the right.
Understanding tool geometry
 23
Relief angle
When introducing tool flanks, we missed one important thing—they should never rub or collide 
against our stock or our machined part.
As you can imagine, the only part of our tool that should ever rub against our stock is our cutting 
edge(s). In the tools seen up until now, there is actually a really large surface rubbing against the 
machined part. Let’s analyze the following screenshot for a better understanding of what is going on:
Figure 1.20: Friction area for a squared tool
As shown in the screenshot by the arrow, all that area is rubbing against the machined side! Not good 
at all! The same is true on the other flank.
To prevent this type of behavior, in real life, the two flanks are always rotated along the cutting edges  
by a relief angle  in order to avoid friction. Every tool always has relief angles, and the  angle value 
cannot be negative; otherwise, cutting edges would never engage the stock (because the bottom of 
the flank will hit the stock first):
Figure 1.21: Relief angles displayed
We can find in the previous screenshot the auxiliary relief angle (on the left) and the main relief angle 
(on the right). These angles avoid friction with the turning stock while machining.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 24
Nose angle
While looking at all the tools displayed up until now, you may have noticed that the angle between 
our cutting edge and our auxiliary cutting edge—called the nose angle —is constantly 90°. Just in case 
you are wondering… more often than not, this is not true; there are many different shapes available 
on the market!
Let’s check the following screenshot to grasp what the nose angle is:
Figure 1.22: Nose angle visualized
Why don’t we try to analyze the tool shown in the screenshot? We should have lots of ways to analyze 
it. At the first glance, we should recognize that it is a positive tool (but almost neutral), that it has 
small relief angles on the two flanks, and as measured by the arrow, the nose angle is 60° with a small 
nose radius as well. Not bad!
This is a somewhat old type of tool; it has a large drawback: once the cutting edge or rake surface is 
really damaged, we have to throw it in the bin and buy a new tool. Today, the most typical approach 
is to have a tool composed of a shank and a swappable insert that can be replaced without changing 
the entire tool.
In the following screenshot, we can see on the left we have an “old-style” tool made in a single piece, while 
on the right side, we have a tool shank and a replaceable insert (both have the same cutting geometry):
Figure 1.23: Insert versus solid tool
Understanding tool geometry
 25
Also, please note that most of these inserts are symmetrical, so they have multiple cutting edges; once 
one of them is spent, we simply rotate the same insert and keep spinning the chuck!
In the following table, you will find a few typical insert examples with different nose angles and their 
suggested use:

Figure 1.24: Tool specifications and typical use
The table shown is divided into two sections. The first part is related to the tool shape, where we can 
find the seven different families, their naming convention, and their shape. The second part of the table 
rates tool usage from “+++” to “0” (with “++” and “+” values in the middle). Let’s review  the usages:
• Versatility : If we were alone on a desert island with our lathe, which tool would we take with 
us? A higher ranking (“+++”) means that that tool is a good choice in many situations and can 
more or less do everything. It is a workhorse and not choosy!
• High-depth roughing : If we need to remove a lot of material with rough passes at high cutting 
depth and high power, we need a very strong tool. A higher ranking (“+++”) means that the 
tool is tough and long-lasting, while a lower ranking (“0”) means that the tool is super sharp 
and will likely break or wear immediately.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 26
• Low-depth roughing : In this scenario, we still need to perform roughing passes but with a 
thinner cutting depth. This case is somewhere between a roughing pass (where we remove a 
lot of material and we don’t mind about tolerances and surface quality) and a finishing pass 
(where we try to get good surface quality and tight tolerances). I decided to include it just to 
let you note that at low cutting depth, the round shape is very bad because it causes vibrations 
(this will be described later in the Entering angle (KAPR)  section).
• Finishing : If we need to finish our part, we probably need to remove a thin layer of material. 
A higher ranking (“+++”) means a super sharp tool suitable for a good surface result.
• Profiling : With this ranking, we are going to evaluate which tool is better for machining 
complex profiles. A higher ranking means that the tool is very good and that it is not limited by 
accessibility issues, while a lower ranking means that the tool may often collide with the stock. 
The main difference between profiling and finishing is that the profiling score also considers 
shape accessibility.
We just mentioned shape accessibility—what does that mean? The answer is simple: slim and sharp 
tools can reach areas beefier and stronger tools cannot. Let’s check the following screenshot:
Figure 1.25: Different accessibility displayed
As we notice at the first glance, the round tool (type R) cannot remove as much material as a rhombic 
tool (type D) because the area to be machined is too deep to reach for it.
We have just taken a look at all the angles that we can find when looking at a tool on the workshop 
shelf. Is this the end? Not really—despite the tool shape, we can always decide to mount it rotated! 
Let me introduce you to the entering angle.
Entering angle (KAPR)
The entering angle  is the  angle measured from the feed direction to the cutting edge.
Understanding tool geometry
 27
Changing the entering angle can dramatically change tool performance and chip management. In 
normal circumstances, it is always a good idea to set the KAPR close to 90°. With flexible parts, we 
should never set an entering angle lower than 70° if possible. The reason is pretty simple: changing 
the angle is actually changing the way our cutting edge is transferring power to the stock material:
Figure 1.26: The same insert mounted at different KAPR angles
As shown on the left of the screenshot, when close to 90°, our tool is transferring power mainly in the 
longitudinal direction, and only a small percentage of the total is transferred as the radial component.
On the right, we can  see that the tool is far from 90°, and therefore the radial component is much  
higher; this is bad, especially with flexible parts, because they will bend.
Why is bending  a bad thing? Let’s review the following screenshot for a better understanding:
Figure 1.27: Bending
As you can see, the screenshot depicts a scenario where a slim part is machined with a longitudinal 
operation. Other than that, we can see that the tool has a 45° entering angle and a high cutting depth, 
which is the perfect recipe for high radial forces that will bend the part while machining.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 28
As you can see at the top of the screenshot, the stock is heavily bent while machining, so we can imagine 
high vibrations due to the runout of the center rotation line and low surface quality.
As we can find at the bottom of the screenshot, after the machining is completed, what should have  
resulted in a nice cylindrical surface appears more like a cone with a higher diameter where the 
bending was more severe!
It may look like a small entering angle is forbidden, but not so fast. There are many different scenarios 
where we may have to use small angles; here are some examples:
• When we want to improve tool life span : At the same cutting depth, with a smaller entering 
angle, a bigger part of our cutting edge is engaged, and therefore the cutting force will be 
distributed over a bigger area with smaller stress on the insert that will last longer.
• When we want to machine a thread : Let’s take a look at the following screenshot for a better 
understanding of this example:
Figure 1.28: Threading operation displayed
As shown in the previous screenshot, when threading we must use an entering angle and a nose 
angle strictly dictated from the thread specs: 60° as KAPR and 60° as the nose angle (for most 
metric threads); that’s why the triangle insert is very often used for threading.
As we already mentioned, remember that when threading, many parameters are locked to 
thread specs: from the thread pitch, we must impose a certain feed step, and from the thread 
angle, we must use a tool with a specific nose angle, entering angle, and maximum nose radius. 
Do not underestimate the nose radius when threading: if it’s too large (over thread specs), the 
nut will not be able to be screwed on.
So, when threading, if we need to reduce vibrations or bending, there is only one parameter 
left… we can change the cutting depth only.
As a bonus point, let’s explain why the round tool shape can be a good choice at high cutting depth 
but may generate high vibrations at low cutting depth. Let’s analyze the following screenshot:
Summary
 29
Figure 1.29: Round-tool KAPR
As you can see, the tool on the left is cutting at a high cutting depth; therefore, it is exchanging all 
the cutting force on a wide range of angles, from almost 90° to 0°, so the radial force generated is not 
a main issue. On the other hand, the tool on the right is engaging a thin layer only, and the cutting 
force is shared from almost 0° to 0°. Such a small KAPR will create massive vibrations—that’s why 
round tools are good for high-depth machining but not so much for low depths (and the same can 
be said for the nose radius).
When facing, a round tool may become handy even at low cutting depth since we don’t care that much 
if the force is transferred to the chuck!
There are many more formulas related to the entering angle, but they are probably way beyond the 
scope of this book, so we won’t deal with them. A last tip on the subject, though: just note that the 
entering angle is also responsible for the chip shape, so remember that the smaller the entering angle, 
the thinner and the wider the chip (and vice versa).
As shown in this last section, we should always pay close attention to the shape of the tools since they 
may look similar, but in reality, they are very different and may be the cause (or the solution) of many 
machining-related problems.
Summary
Congratulations! That was the end of the first chapter—I hope that the journey up until now was 
easy and pleasant.
Let’s quickly recap what we learned during this chapter. Firstly, we saw what turning is and how it 
shapes our parts, and discovered what the main components of a lathe are. After this, we moved to 
something a bit more technical: studying the cutting parameters and how we can control them and 
evaluate the cutting power required. Then, we moved forward to the main machining strategies used 
when turning and saw the main geometries of our tools and how they can affect machining.
Getting Started with Turning and Its Tools 30
All these elements are key for better awareness while planning a machining strategy. I encourage 
you to experiment and widen your knowledge by studying the specs of the tools you use on the 
manufacturer’s datasheet.
Please note that this chapter was an introduction to turning. We should now understand a bit better 
what we are talking about, but we definitely cannot consider ourselves turning experts. We had to 
simplify many concepts, and we made a brutal approximation; however, for most typical beginners, 
the provided knowledge level should be spot on.
Now, follow me to the next chapter where we are going to experiment with something more practical: 
using the Fusion 360 CAM module for our first turning machining setup.2
Handling Part Setup  
for Turning
In this chapter, we will run the Fusion 360 Manufacture  environment for the first time and learn how 
to approach our part setup.
Mastering the Setup  panels is not very simple because there are many different tabs, commands, and 
parameters to understand and tweak. However, the goal of this chapter is to explore in detail (whenever 
possible) all of the options that the setup process requires us to specify.
Sometimes, we can simply try to copy someone else’s parameters and pray that they fit our needs too. 
Doing so may lead to a fast start, but it will also leave gaps in our theory. The best mindset to have 
is to always critically watch every option and wonder why it is set the way it is and what would have 
happened if it were different.
In the following chapters, we are going to have lots of practical examples to analyze and follow, but 
for now, let’s try to arrive at those chapters with a solid background understanding; it will be much 
more rewarding!
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Exploring the main interface of a computer-aided manufacturing  (CAM ) project
• Finding example projects in Fusion 360
• Importing our chuck
• Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
Technical requirements
The only requirement for this chapter is to have a Fusion 360 license (at any level) so that we can 
launch the CAM module and start using it.Handling Part Setup for Turning 32
Exploring the main interface of a CAM project
Before  jumping into action, let’s review the main interface for the CAM module. It is quite similar to 
the computer-aided design  (CAD ) module interface:
Figure 2.1: Main Fusion 360 interface
Please note that we are inside the MANUFACTURE  module, which is a fancy way to refer to CAM. 
All the commands and panels we will use in this chapter are from the MANUFACTURE  environment, 
so please be sure to set the working environment correctly.
Note
CAM is a term to refer to software we use to program our computer numerical control  (CNC ) 
machine. We can find all the CAM commands inside the MANUFACTURE  environment of 
Fusion 360.
On the other hand, CAD is a term to refer to a type of software to design our parts. As you should 
already know, you can find all the CAD tools inside the DESIGN  environment of Fusion 360.
Finding example projects in Fusion 360
 33
Let’s  review the most important elements on the screenshot:
1. Project name : In our case, it’s 2X Turning – Quick Release .
2. Machining tabs : Under the different tabs, we can find commands related to different machining 
types. As we can see in the example, the TURNING  tab is selected, and we can find all the 
machining strategies such as facing  and profiling .
3. Project units : The units can be shown in millimeters  (mm) or inches  (in). We should always 
be very careful when it comes to which measurement units the project uses; in some examples, 
it may use mm, while in others, it may use in—therefore, copying numbers or tools from a 
built-in example to our project may cause confusion.
4. Main model tree : Here, we can find all the bodies made in the DESIGN  environment of 
Fusion 360.
5. Chuck model : As you can see, the chuck is part of the 3D geometry. We can have models to be 
used just for reference—for example, vises, chucks, build platforms, and so on.
6. Setup folder : Here, we will set stock dimensions and the World Coordinate System  (WCS ). 
This is the  coordinate system that all our turning operations inside this setup will use as the 
origin, and will be explored later in the chapter.
7. Operations list : Here, we can find all of the machining steps required to build our part. For 
example, in this list, we have all the operations, from the very first roughing passes to finishing 
passes up until the stock cut once the part is completed.
8. Part model : This is the final 3D model that we want to get after all the turning operations are 
performed on the stock.
9. Chuck 3D model : A 3D model used just for reference for collision analysis.
10. View options : In the MANUFACTURE  environment, we have multiple new options (not 
available in other environments) related to the CAM path and CAM elements. For example, 
we can display the toolpaths, the machine, the machined stock, and so on. We are going to use 
these commands in the following chapters, but at the moment, just remember that these options 
are a bit different from those found inside the DESIGN  environment that you are used to using.
If you opened the MANUFACTURE  environment for the first time, the interface will be a blank 
default. However, there are many built-in examples where we can study someone else’s work.
Finding example projects in Fusion 360
One reason why Fusion 360 is a really good entry point for beginners is that there are many examples 
already built into the program that we can use to start learning from.Handling Part Setup for Turning 34
Let’s find out where those examples are located:
1. Open the side panel by clicking on the icon that looks like a grid of squares.
2. With the side panel now open, you can scroll through the projects.
3. Then, select the folder called CAM Samples :
Figure 2.2: Location of the CAM Samples folder
Importing our chuck
 35
Inside this folder, there are tons of built-in projects related to CAM and machining in general. In fact, 
the number is so high that it may be a bit overwhelming at first, but over time, you will explore the 
folders and find examples of interest.
Please also note that the CAM Samples  folder is not only useful to study machining operations—inside 
the folder, there is another folder called Workholding ; here, you can find many useful models that 
we can use, such as vises, chucks, working tables, clamping devices, and so on.
This is great news since it is always a good idea to check for collisions while programming our CNC. 
In order to avoid any collision when machining, we should consider the shape of our lathe and all 
its components close to the machining area such as the chuck and the tool holder; therefore, we can 
model our lathe and import it inside our CAM project. But we may also find something already pretty 
close to our machine without wasting a single minute on modeling all the components.
Let’s now open the project example named 2X Turning – Quick Release  (located in the CAM Samples  
folder) and jump to the next section.
It is now time to start our CAM project. We are supposed to already have a part to machine, but maybe 
we don’t have a chuck inside the project – let's just import one for our needs.
Importing our chuck
As we already discussed, in order to  avoid collisions between our tool and our chuck, it is a good idea 
to have something that emulates the size of our chuck or our components inside our 3D world. We 
are about to discover how to simulate chuck placement; however, just before moving forward, I’ d like 
to highlight what I consider a bad type of advertising.
If you have ever watched any advertisement for CAM software, you have probably noticed that 
alongside the machined part, not only there is a chuck or a tool holder in place, but there are also lots 
of complex details of the machine. The truth is that all that stuff is there just for marketing purposes!
In order to find possible collisions between the stock and our machine or between the tool and our 
machine, a set of properly placed boxes is as effective as a super fancy 3D model with all those extra 
details. However, Fusion 360 provides a pretty big group of work-holding tools, so we may decide to 
use some of them without an extra modeling effort.
Since the sample projects are in read-only mode, it is a good idea to start from one of the built-in 
models and save it with another name in our project folder.
There is a very fancy chuck model (in other words, overly detailed) that we are going to use for the 
first examples, which is called Generic 3 Jaw Chuck  (located inside CAM Samples  | Workholding ). 
So, open the Generic 3 Jaw Chuck  model and then save it in your active project folder. Now, you can 
open the copy and modify it according to the chuck specs of your machine (remember—you don’t 
really need to create anything super detailed!).Handling Part Setup for Turning 36
Let’s take a look at the sample chuck:
Figure 2.3: Built-in chuck
You will note  that this model is very smart, including a set of constraints that can simulate the motion 
of the jaws . As shown in the screenshot, we can click and drag one of the jaws to open or  close our 
chuck (that’s pretty much useless, but very impressive nonetheless!).
Note
The jaws of the chuck are moving parts that close around our stock with a strong grasp and 
transfer the chuck torque when spinning.
It is now time to import the chuck inside the 3D CAM project. Since this book is not aimed at complete 
beginners of Fusion 360, we will assume that you are already able to produce complex 3D models 
inside the DESIGN  environment; for that reason, we’ll suppose that we have already designed our 
part to be machined and we want to import our chuck inside the assembly.
To do this, it is a very simple procedure:
1. Open the side panel (if closed).
2. Navigate through the project folder.
3. Locate the Generic 3 Jaw Chuck  file inside the folder.
4. Right-click on  the file and choose Insert into Current Design :
Importing our chuck
 37
Figure 2.4: How to insert a chuck into our current design
After the import, we should be presented with something like this:
Figure 2.5: Chuck imported
Handling Part Setup for Turning 38
As shown in the  screenshot, after we import the chuck, we can decide the position of our 3D model 
inside the world. We can use all the common tools we should already know and love from the DESIGN  
environment to translate and rotate the chuck model properly, making sure to align the chuck rotation 
axis with the part rotation axis.
Once we have aligned them, we can move the chuck and set the distance between our machined part 
and the end of our chuck. But how far from the part do we have to place the chuck?
Figure 2.6: Chuck distance
To answer this question, we have to consider a few important points:
• Despite the part length, do we need to machine the entire length or only a certain area? If we 
don't need to machine the entire length, we may decide to insert a portion of our part inside 
the chuck; in that case, X would be negative.
• Do we want to cut the part after machining? If so, we must consider extra space for tool width, 
shank size, and insert clearance. In this case, X would be positive.
• Is it a flexible part? Remember that the higher the distance, the higher the bending while 
machining. So, you may want to set it just to the correct distance to be able to cut it and not 
much more.
In most cases, there is no real reason to work in a very tight space between the rear of the machined 
part and the end of the chuck.
Now that we have positioned the chuck, we can move forward to our first CAM setup!
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 39
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
First of all, what is a setup ? The answer is very simple—it is a set of commands and parameters that 
we specify for the starting conditions of our project. It is the first mandatory step in order to move 
forward with any machining. All those conditions and parameters will tell Fusion 360 how to use and 
optimize the machining process.
Note
We may have a single setup or multiple setups one after the other. We need a new 
setup every time we plan to change the coordinate system or machining processes.  
We will cover multi-setup operations in Chapter 9  and Chapter 10 .
So, where is the SETUP  button? If you can’t find it, let’s check its location:
1. Ensure that you’re in the MANUFACTURE  environment.
2. Then, open the TURNING  panel.
3. Select the SETUP  button (which looks like an open folder):
Figure 2.7: The SETUP button
Handling Part Setup for Turning 40
When you launch the command, there are three main tabs:
• Setup
• Stock
• Post Process
Let’s take a look at each of these now.
Setup tab
Inside the Setup  tab, we can specify all information related to the coordinate system and the machine 
geometry. In the following screenshot, we find a preview of the panel:
Figure 2.8: The Setup panel
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 41
Here, there are several subpanels to be aware of:
• Machine
• Setup
• Work Coordinate System (WCS)
• Safe Z
• Model
• Chuck
Let’s go through them one by one.
Note
The Setup  panel and subpanels are going to be influenced by the type of machining we are 
using, so not every command or option may be available with every setup type. At the moment, 
we are going to analyze a turning setup.
Machine
This is a super fancy option that allows us to import a built-in CNC machine inside the working project 
for simulation purposes. At the moment, the Fusion 360 library doesn’t come with any lathe models 
to use; however, don’t worry about this—as already discussed, importing a complete 3D machine in 
our project is cool but also pretty much useless, and the option is not mandatory during setup anyway.
Setup
Inside the Setup  subpanel, we can  find all the options to specify the type of machining we want to 
implement. Here, we have two options:
• Operation type
• Spindle
What do they mean?
Operation type
Operation type  refers to the machining we want to perform. There are different types of machines 
out there, and not all of them are lathes; some are milling machines, some laser cutters, and some 
combine multiple technologies—therefore, we must specify the type of machining we want to use.Handling Part Setup for Turning 42
Spindle
In the case of a Turning  setup, we are asked to provide information about chuck configuration. What 
does this mean? The answer is that not every lathe is similar to others; there are  advanced types of 
lathes with more than a single chuck (also called a spindle ).
But why would anyone use two chucks instead of just one? There are two main reasons. We have 
already mentioned one: flexible parts may require additional support in order to be machined without 
excessive bending. But the second reason is that when using a single chuck, we can only machine one 
side of our stock since part of it is inserted inside the chuck itself. With two chucks, we can overcome 
that limitation; check the following screenshot for a better understanding:
Figure 2.9: Two chucks working
We can split the procedure into four steps:
1. The cutting tool cannot move anymore; it is very close to the main chuck, and most of the 
stock we need to machine is inside the jaws. In short, the part of the stock we need to machine 
is inaccessible.
2. The tool is moved at a safe radial distance, and the auxiliary chuck closes the jaws onto the 
stock already machined.
3. The auxiliary chuck is then moved away from the main chuck.
4. The tool can now start machining the previously hidden side of the stock.
As you can imagine, this type of operation is a bit more advanced, so for the sake of simplicity, we are 
going to ignore multiple chuck setups (however, do be aware of this useful option).
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 43
Work Coordinate System (WCS)
This is one of the most important sections inside the Setup  panels, but what is our WCS?
WCS is the local coordinate system of the stock we want to machine. Every position or movement of 
our cutting tool will be described as a set of coordinates measured from such a coordinate system. 
It is a bit like the Battleship  game where we need to set a coordinate system to manage ship position 
and shot positions.
In the same way, we need to tell Fusion 360 where the origin of our coordinate system is and where 
our directions are pointing. As explained in, we already mentioned that Fusion 360, as with almost 
every CNC, is working on Cartesian coordinates; this means that after specifying the origin location, 
we have to set x, y, and z axis orientation.
Fusion 360 is quite capable of automatic stock placement so, most of the time, it is able to preset the 
coordinate system properly with the right origin and the right rotation axis. That’s not always the 
case, though…
Figure 2.10: Wrong automatic placement
As we can see in  the preceding screenshot, with complex shapes or if we  imported a chuck or other 
fixture, it may mistake the WCS placement and orientation. This means that we have to manually 
specify the coordinates.
Handling Part Setup for Turning 44
How to do that? Simply click on the Orientation  dropdown:
Figure 2.11: Orientation options
As you can see, there are  several options we can pick in order to specify the WCS orientation:
• Model orientation : We get the coordinate system from our part to be machined, and we keep 
the same orientation of the axes (this is an option rarely used).
• Select Z axis/plane & X axis  or /plane & Y axis  or /plane & X point : We pick the rotation axis 
(z axis) first, and then we define another element to set the other two axes ( x and y).
• Select coordinate system : With this option, we can specify any WCS inside the project to be 
used. This can be a WCS from our 3D model or the chuck or any submodel.
Note
By default, Fusion 360 considers the z axis as the rotation axis and the x axis as the radial 
direction that our tool is moving along. This is typical for most machines; however, yours may 
be different, so please check your axes orientation.
After we set the orientation of the x, y, and z axes, we also need to adjust the tip direction. Fusion 360 
gives us the option of flipping these axes:
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 45
Figure 2.12: Flip axis button
Let’s now suppose  we click on Flip X Axis . What is the outcome?
Figure 2.13: Different WCS orientation
On the left, we  can see the WCS orientation before flipping, while on the right, we can see the orientation 
after the command is pressed. As we would have guessed, the x axis is now pointing in the opposite 
direction, while the z axis is unchanged. Y ou may have also noticed that the y axis is flipped, a subtle 
change that leads us to our next point.
Every coordinate system in any 3D software is “right-handed. ” This means that if we point our right 
thumb along the x axis and our right forefinger along the y axis, then our right middle finger will 
always point in the z direction.
Handling Part Setup for Turning 46
Note
If you are not able to orient all the axes the way you want after a few axis flips, the chances are 
high that you are trying to set a forbidden “left-handed” WCS. If this is the case, you have no 
choice other than to set the best right-handed WCS for your needs.
Also, it is important to remember that the z axis orientation may influence the coordinate value assumed 
by the tool while working. Let’s check the following screenshot to understand how:
Figure 2.14: Different WCS orientation (continued)
As you can see, on the left, all the coordinates of our part are negative, while on the right, they are all 
positive. The same tool at the same position will be described by a different set of coordinates on the 
right example and on the left example.
This is also true for the resulting toolpaths; they will look the same to our eyes, but in reality, they are 
different and not compatible. Therefore, copying a toolpath from the right setup to the left setup will 
produce unexpected movements!
Also, note that the x axis is unchanged, the z axis is flipped, and due to the right-hand rule, the y axis 
is flipped as well.
Once we set the right orientation of our WCS, it is time to set the origin location. In order to specify 
the origin point, we have multiple options to choose from:
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 47
Figure 2.15: Origin point setup
Here, we can set the origin at the front of the 3D model we want to machine or at the back. We 
can also specify a point along the z axis where the chuck ends (known as the chuck front) or at the 
boundaries of our stock.
Most of the time, I choose to set the origin at Stock front  with the z axis  pointing outward because 
I like to use negative coordinates when machining my parts, but this is something I like to do and is 
not mandatory for you; you can set the origin wherever you prefer.
We should now be quite confident in all the options related to WCS placement and orientation, so 
let’s move forward!
Safe Z
In the Safe Z  section, we  can specify where the tool can move safely in the radial direction without 
colliding with our part. We have two values to set, which are Safe Z Reference  and Offset .
Safe Z Reference
This is a z coordinate  we set as a safe position for our tool. After this z coordinate, our tool should be 
able to get any radial position without colliding with the stock or the chuck. Are you a bit confused?
To get a better understanding, suppose we need to move our tool toward the rotation axis ( z) for whatever 
reason. This movement is not intended as a cutting operation, so the chuck may also be standing still:
Handling Part Setup for Turning 48
Figure 2.16: Safe Z
As you can see from the example, the WCS origin is set on the front of our stock. If we try to move 
our tool toward the rotation axis while located at negative z coordinates (on the left of the dashed 
plane), it will crash against the stock.
On the right of the dashed plane, we no longer risk crashing into the stock.
In this example, the dashed plane can be considered a Safe Z  plane type—it divides z coordinates 
between safe and potentially unsafe areas.
Please note that the Safe Z  plane refers to the tip of our tool only; it doesn’t consider the tool and 
shank dimensions. Therefore, most of the time, we need to add an extra offset value to avoid collisions.
The typical Safe Z  position is on the front of our stock ( Stock front ), on the opposite side of the chuck:
Figure 2.17: Safe Z Reference options
We can specify a different position such as Stock back  or WCS origin , but 99% of the time, you will 
set it to Stock front .
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 49
Offset
As already  mentioned, Offset  is a safety margin from Safe Z Reference  that takes into account insert 
and shank shape. Even if the tool shape shouldn’t collide with the stock, it is still a good idea to specify 
a bit of offset. Can you guess why?
Figure 2.18: Safe Z offset
As you can see in the previous example, the insert should be able to move along the Safe Z plane 
without any collision. But in reality, the front of the stock may be cut at an angle, or it may be a bit 
rough and still cause rubbing (which is bad) or collisions (which is worse). Therefore, we should 
always add a bit of offset from the Safe Z  plane and be sure that there is always a layer of air between 
the tool and the stock when not cutting.
A safety gap of  at least 5-10 mm is always a good idea.
Note
Depending on the z axis orientation, a positive offset value may increase the gap or decrease 
it, so you should always check twice!
Handling Part Setup for Turning 50
But thanks to Fusion 360, it is quite simple to visualize the planes when preparing our setup:
Figure 2.19: Offset plane
As you may have noticed from the screenshot (or from your screen), there is a light blue circle that 
we can move by dragging on the arrow that represents the Safe Z  plane, and there is an offset of 15 
mm from the stock front.
Note
As previously mentioned, flipping the z axis will invert the offset value. With the z axis pointing 
inward (with the WCS origin at the stock front), negative offset values will result in air between 
the stock front and our tool!
Model
In the Model  subpanel, we can pick a model to machine among the group inside the project. Here, 
we can find two commands:
• Model
• Spun Profile
What are they used for?
Model
The most straightforward  setup occurs when we have only a single part inside the project. However, 
as already discussed, we may have multiple models inside our 3D environment. For example, we may 
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 51
want to machine a welded assembly with multiple subcomponents, or we may have a work-holding 
fixture or a chuck.
With multiple parts inside the project, Fusion 360 may start panicking because it will not understand 
which is the model to be machined. Its default behavior is to consider all the parts available as machinable. 
With the Model  command, we can pick only the model we intend to process with our lathe.
Note
After the selection, Fusion 360 will try to arrange stock placement and WCS again. Therefore, 
this should be the first command you use when beginning a setup!
Spun Profile
Spun Profile  is an  option that allows us to manage complex parts that have both turning features and 
milling features on a lathe. Most of the time, despite our lathe being such a useful machine, we may 
need geometries that are not axially symmetric; therefore, we cannot machine those only by turning.
For example, we may need to create a slot inside our part. Why is this a problem for Fusion 360? To 
answer this question, we have to know how Fusion 360 handles toolpath generation. At first, it will 
cut the 3D model in half by slicing it, and then it will take the cross section and use the outer contour 
for toolpath coordinates:
Figure 2.20: Spun Profile on/off
As you can see from the screenshot, the model on the left has a slot, and the resulting cross section is 
displaying it. Therefore, Fusion 360 will consider the left profile as an axially symmetric part, which, 
in reality, is quite different from what we want to machine. In order to avoid this type of problem, we 
should remove the unmachinable geometries first. As you can see, on the  right part, we removed the 
slot and restored the cylindrical shape. This operation is called defeaturing .
Handling Part Setup for Turning 52
Note
Defeaturing is an operation related to parts that need to be simplified. There are several possible 
reasons for defeaturing. For example, we may need to reduce the file dimension of a complex 
assembly, or we may need to simulate physics. In order to reduce computation time, we can 
decide to remove useless features.
Thanks to Fusion 360, we don’t have to manually remove features; there is a useful option that does 
just that. With Spun Profile  checked, we can select the profile to be machined by our lathe while 
ignoring all the features we plan to machine on our mill. We can consider this command a sort of 
defeaturing command.
Still confused about Spun Profile ? Take a look at the following screenshot for a better understanding:
Figure 2.21: Spun Profile
As you can see, the model is not turnable since it has a heavy milled face that totally breaks its axial 
symmetry (it is basically cut in half). Even if Fusion 360 shouldn’t recognize the cylindrical profile, 
after enabling Spun Profile  in the setup, Fusion 360 still recognizes its round shape cross section 
(highlighted in blue in the example).
Chuck
The Chuck  subpanel  is where we specify our fancy geometry for our chuck for collision simulation. 
Here, we find two subcommands: Chuck reference  and Offset .
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 53
Chuck reference
Chuck reference  is where we set the position of our chuck. There are multiple options to choose from:
Figure 2.22: Chuck setup
As you can see, there are several options; however, most of them are self-explanatory:
• Stock front : We can set the chuck position on the front of the stock
• Stock back : The chuck will begin at the back of the stock (this is very common)
• Model front : This will set the chuck position on the front face of our 3D model
• Model back : The chuck will be positioned at the end of the 3D model
• From solid : Instead of specifying a plane on the z axis, we can pick, model by model, every 
component of the chuck if we imported one into the project
With most of the options, we specify a plane (much like we did with Safe Z Reference ). In this case, 
we may call it Danger Z Reference ; after this value on the z axis, we can be sure that our tool will 
collide and break something valuable.
Offset
The Offset  value  is intended as a safety margin before collision and is similar to the Offset  value for 
the Safe Z  plane (everything said for the Safe Z  plane also applies to this value as well).
Handling Part Setup for Turning 54
Thanks to Fusion 360, it is always clear where the Safe Z  plane and the Chuck  plane are located, as 
you can see in the following screenshot:
Figure 2.23: Chuck plane
Here, you can see that there is a green plane that we can drag along the z axis, which will be where 
the chuck starts. It is always a good idea to work with high offset values, at least 15-20 mm, so that 
we can be sure that no collision will occur.
It is important not to underestimate the strength of a tool’s impact against the chuck; with several 
kilowatts involved, a tool fragment may become a dangerous projectile. Do not bypass machine safeties, 
and always wear protective glasses!
So, we have now discovered the first tab of the Setup  command, where we explored topics such as 
WCS and the Safe Z  plane; now, let’s move on to the next tab.
Stock tab
Inside the Stock  tab, we can  find all the parameters related to the stock shape and dimensions. In the 
following screenshot, we can find a preview of the panel:
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 55
Figure 2.24: The Stock panel
Fortunately, the only parameter we really need to be looking at is the Mode  option inside the Stock  
subpanel. It will change the way we specify the stock shape and its dimensions:
Figure 2.25: Mode options
Handling Part Setup for Turning 56
As you can see, we can specify different shapes to machine with our lathe; some of them are for square 
stocks, while others are for cylindrical stocks or tube stocks. When you specify a shape, some of the 
options may change slightly.
So, let’s check each of the shapes and options now.
Fixed size box
With Fixed size box , we can specify a squared stock to be machined by providing the global dimensions:
Figure 2.26: Fixed size box
As you can see, not only do we have to specify the global dimensions of the bounding box but we also 
need to set the Model Position  value, which is an offset along the specified axis.
Relative size box
The Relative size box  option  is similar to the previous one since it creates a squared stock; however, 
it is different in the way we specify the shape. Let’s check the following parameters:
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 57
Figure 2.27: Relative size box
Here, we do not specify the bounding box dimensions for our stock, as Fusion 360 automatically 
calculates the needed stock size to machine our part. However, we can set extra stock thickness around 
our object by specifying offsets along the three axes.
Note
Why would we want to set extra stock around our object? Because our stock may not be a perfect 
box—it may be bent, or it may be a bit smaller, or it may be rusted. In all of these scenarios, 
we add extra material to be removed around the part, allowing us to be more confident about 
the final result.
This was the second “box mode, ” but to tell you the truth, it is very rare to start from a box stock when 
turning metals. Instead, we always start from an axially symmetric stock such as a cylinder. That’s 
because non-round stocks will generate strong vibrations and strong impacts on our tool.
Handling Part Setup for Turning 58
Fixed size cylinder
Fixed size cylinder  is one of the most used modes when turning; it creates a round stock with specified 
dimensions. We just have to specify the Stock Diameter  value and its Length  value:
Figure 2.28: Fixed size cylinder
Similar to Fixed size box , we can specify an Offset  value from the front of our stock or from the back 
(again, this should be used if we need extra precision regarding the final result).
Relative size cylinder
This option is similar to Relative size box . With this option, we don’t specify a diameter and a length; 
we have to set how much additional stock we want around our part.
Fixed size tube
Ver y  similar to Fixed size cylinder , here we create a hollow cylinder (a tube), so we need to provide 
the outer diameter, inner diameter, and length.
Relative size tube
At this point, you should now understand the difference between fixed size and relative size, so with 
Relative size tube , we can specify additional material around the tube needed to machine our part.
From solid
From solid  is a very interesting option. Instead of specifying a default shape such as a cylinder or a 
tube, here, we can pick a 3D model inside the project to be the stock. This option is very useful; for 
Understanding how to set up the first part to be machined
 59
example, we can use it when we need to machine a part that was created from another manufacturing 
process, such as a metal casting or a welded assembly.
From preceding setup
Since, as we discussed, there can be multiple setups listed one after the other, with this option, we can 
acquire stock dimensions from the previous setup. Please note that WCS placement has nothing to 
do with stock. This mode only retrieves stock dimensions. Frankly speaking, I’ve almost never used 
this option.
Finally, we completed all the stock creation modes; they should not be very difficult to master. There’s 
one last thing to note. While looking at all the stock mode panels, the most curious of you may have 
noticed a recurring checkbox called Continue Rest Machining :
Figure 2.29: Continue Rest Machining
What does it mean? This option is very important as it allows us to keep working on the stock machined 
on a previous setup! For example, imagine that we started machining with our lathe on the first setup. 
After turning the part, if we need to keep milling our stock, we need to create an additional setup. 
However, with Continue Rest Machining  checked, Fusion 360 will consider the already removed material 
and will not try to machine air (where the material was already removed from previous operations)!
We have now completed the second tab of the Setup  command, where we discovered many options for 
stock placement and shape. There is just one more tab to discover, and that is related to postprocessing.
The Post Process tab
There is  just one more tab to analyze before we can say that we have mastered setup options: the Post 
Process  tab.
But first of all, what is postprocessing ? It is the junction between our CAM module and our CNC 
machine—a sort of  translation between our 3D model language and our machine language.
The language spoken by our 3D software is quite advanced, made up of complex 3D shapes, materials, 
and colors. However, even the most expensive CNC machine—whether it is a lathe, a mill, or a 
3D printer—is quite dumb; it is mainly able to understand simple numbers. The postprocessor , a 
subprogram that manages the postprocess, converts the most complex  information from our CAM 
into simple formulas and coordinates that our machine can understand. The language created by the 
postprocessor and understood by the machine is commonly called G-code .
Handling Part Setup for Turning 60
Note
G-code is a proper programming language. We could write very simple programs ourselves, 
but we would need to follow specific rules and a strict syntax; any error, or even a misplaced 
comma, would cause a machine emergency.
Also, every CNC machine may speak a slightly different G-code language, so a 
program that works flawlessly on our CNC may be unreadable by another. Due to this, 
we may need to use different postprocessors according to the machine we want to use.  
 
Fusion 360 comes with a decent set of postprocessors that work for several common machines, 
but there’s a chance yours may not be compatible. Before buying Fusion 360 or a CNC machine, 
you should always check that they can work together by default or by a third-party plugin. If 
not, don’t waste your money!
This is not the best starting point to understand G-code and postprocessing, since we are still at the 
beginning of our journey inside the CAM world. So, for now, let’s just remember the key concept 
behind it: it is a translation process.
In the following screenshot, we can find the Post Process  panel inside the Setup  command:
Figure 2.30: The Post Process tab
As you can see from the screenshot, this panel is quite slim, but there are some important options 
to understand.
Program Name/Number
As we mentioned, G-code  is a set of instructions written in the language spoken by our CNC machine. 
A typical set of instructions to machine a part may consist of hundreds of instructions and commands; 
therefore, the instructions have to be stored in a file.
Summary
 61
With the Program Name/Number  option, we provide the name for this file once it has been created (do 
keep in mind that certain machines may want a custom program name convention with a strict syntax).
Program Comment
Since a G-code file is written  in a language easily understandable only by a machine, if we decided 
to open it with our text editor, we would almost certainly lose the idea of what the set of instructions 
is used for. That’s because when G-code is opened with a text editor, it consists of thousands of 
coordinates listed.
Using Program Comment , we can add a line to the beginning of the file that will help us to retrieve 
important information in the future. This comment is never read by the machine; therefore, we can  
write it in human language.
As an example, we may want to add a few words related to stock dimensions or WCS placement or 
the material to be machined, or anything that may help us in the future.
Machine WCS
This is the last section of our setup, but unfortunately, at the moment, it is way too advanced for us 
to understand and is slightly beyond the scope of this book. Saying that, we will return to this topic 
in Chapter 8 , when we will set up a multi-placement milling operation; it is mostly used when we 
need to change the machine coordinate system—for example, with multiple stocks to be machined.
For now, you can leave the Machine WCS  settings as is.
And with that, we have completed quite a deep overview of all the possibilities available inside the 
Setup  command for turning operations. What a milestone!
Summary
Congratulations—that’s the end of the second chapter! I hope that you are getting more confident 
with the first steps inside the Fusion 360 CAM module.
Let’s quickly recap what we learned during this chapter. We started by discovering where we can 
find useful example projects that we can use in our setups, before exploring the MANUFACTURE  
module interface.
After that, we learned how to import a chuck (or any other generic workholding stuff inside our 
project) and reviewed all the options available inside the Setup  panels. Finally, we got a hint about 
postprocessing and G-code.
Please always remember that a good setup is the best way to approach better machining without 
risking unwanted collisions or a bad WCS placement.
This chapter has taken us one step closer to spinning our chuck. In the next chapter, we will discover 
where to find the tools to machine our part.3
Discovering the Tool Library 
and Custom Tools
In this chapter, we are going to discover the built-in tool library of Fusion 360 and how to import new 
tools to use in our machining strategies. However, unfortunately, Fusion 360 doesn’t come with many 
turning tools inside the default library.
Are we forced to only use these tools? Of course not!
We have several options to expand our toolset, all of which we will explore in this chapter. This includes 
creating a tool from scratch, an option that is quite time-consuming but allows for the highest flexibility.
Another option we will explore is importing an entirely new library alongside the default tool library. 
This will give us the tools we need but also many more tools we don’t. The other option we will explore 
is using a third-party plugin.
The goal of this chapter is to get you used to multiple new environments where you can find useful 
resources about tools and their geometry.
Do not underestimate the importance of a proper tool library – using the right tool for the right 
operation is critical as doing so is the key to long-lasting tools, good surface finish, and good tolerance!
So, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Discovering the tool library
• Creating a new tool
• Importing a third-party tool library
• Importing new tools with a plugin (CoroPlus)Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 64
Technical requirements
To follow along with this chapter, you need to have read most of the previous chapters; the first chapter 
is mandatory, but the second chapter can be skipped as we won’t mention much of what was stated there.
Y ou will also need a working license for Fusion 360 and an internet connection to download 
additional content.
Also, note that at the end of this chapter, we will mention a third-party plugin called CoroPlus that 
requires its own paid license. Though it is a bonus, it is not strictly necessary for our CAM journey.
Discovering the tool library
Before starting any turning operations, we must take a look at the tools that Fusion 360 has to offer. 
Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a lot of tools to pick from; the options are quite limited, to say 
the least.
Where do we find the tools? In the Tool Library , of course:
Figure 3.1: Tool Library location
Let’s click on the icon and open the library:
Creating a new tool
 65
Figure 3.2: Tool library
Inside the  tool library, we can find many different tools; these are not only related to turning – there 
are also milling tools, tool holders, laser nozzles, and so on.
Most of the time, the large number of tools available may be a bit overwhelming. To find the tools that we 
need, we have to know how to navigate inside the tool library. Let’s break down the previous screenshot:
1. In the left column, there is a list of all the available libraries. To search for all the built-in tools, 
we must select Fusion 360 Library .
2. To reduce how many tools and holders are available to us, we can set a filter on the right-hand 
column; as you can see, we have just set a Turning  filter, so only turning tools are listed.
3. At the moment, the number of tools available is quite limited (this is especially true if we 
remember the  variety of operations and shapes that we discovered in Chapter 1 ).
Don’t worry – even if there aren’t many tools built in, Fusion 360 still allows us to expand the tool 
library through other methods. As mentioned in the introduction, we can create tools ourselves, import 
third-party libraries, or use plugins. In the following pages, we will discover these different options.
Creating a new tool
The first way to add tools to the  limited built-in tool library is to create our own! This is the least 
expensive option but is also a bit more time-consuming.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 66
Fusion 360 allows us to create a new tool from scratch and set all the needed parameters. Of course, 
we do not have to reinvent the wheel; we can simply start from the real tools we have at our disposal 
and copy their geometry. Alternatively, we can search for the tool we need inside a turning tool brand, 
copy it, and then buy it if it fits our needs.
Imagine that we need to add a new tool, such as a new finishing tool. We do not have to create a tool 
with our imagination; the best idea is to start looking on tool brand websites for their finishing tools 
lineup or check what we already have at our disposal on the shelf.
Getting a sample tool
Now, let’s suppose we found  an interesting tool on our favorite tool shop website with the 
following specifications:
Figure 3.3: Example tool specifications
If we use quality tools, we should always find all the pieces of information needed to set up our tool. 
As shown in the preceding figure, we are provided with all the details we learned about in Chapter 1 ; 
there are just a couple of things I’ d like to point out since we haven’t found those yet.
One useful thing to know is that almost every tool has a specific ISO-code  assigned to it. For example, 
the insert we are about to use is completely described with the ISO-code only ( WCMT06T308 ). 
Creating a new tool
 67
Therefore, we can refer to such an insert by specifying all the geometry parameters or by simply using 
its code. Please note that standard ISO-codes are not brand dependent, so we can find the same insert 
made by different brands.
Y ou may have noticed another angle called Trailing Angle , which is the angle that allows our shank 
not to impact the stock while contouring; the higher the angle, the better the accessibility.
Now that we have all the specifications of our tool, we can create a clone inside Fusion 360.
Creating a new tool
To create a new tool, the first step is to open the tool library:
Figure 3.4: Local tool library
As we’ve already discovered, there is the built-in Fusion 360 Library , which contains a lot of tools. 
However, note that this library is read-only, which means that we can access all the tools, but we cannot 
modify them or add more to the list.
Instead, we can use our Local library  to store all the newly created tools. Once selected, we will find 
all our tools listed. If we want to add one, we can just press the + button (if the button is unavailable, 
you are probably inside a read-only library!).
Note
Please be careful not to save tools inside the current document. Saving tools inside the document 
will make them inaccessible when working with any other document.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 68
Let’s click on the + button. We  will be presented with a list of all the possible tools we can create. For 
this, we are looking for an external turning tool, so click on Turning general :
Figure 3.5: New tool type
Now, we will be presented with a new  window with multiple tabs – General , Insert , Holder , Setup , 
Cutting data , and Post processor  – where we can specify all the necessary data. We will go through 
each tab now. Don’t worry – we don’t have to fill in every detail available; there are a few shortcuts!
General
On the General  tab, we can add  the main information related to the tool we are about to create:
Figure 3.6: The General tab
Creating a new tool
 69
Inside the Description  field, we can add any note related to the tool’s intended usage, surface coating, 
price, and so on.
With Vendor , we can specify the supplier, and with Product id , we can specify the vendor code for 
future purchases – these are very handy fields to have.
Finally, we can add  a Product link  to the seller’s web page to make things even easier.
Let’s now move to the following tab called Insert .
Insert
On the Insert  tab, we can specify all the specifications for our cutting insert. As shown in the following 
screenshot, there are many parameters. We could waste a lot of time manually typing all the values one 
by one, but most of the time we can simply copy and paste the needed ISO code inside the text box:
Figure 3.7: The Insert tab
Here, I copied the  ISO code from the previous insert datasheet, and the insert geometry was 
automatically created with the same shape. However, the shank still looks quite different from what 
we saw previously; we will discover how to change it in the following tab.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 70
Holder
Unfortunately, Fusion 360 doesn’t support any shank coding, so we have to edit shank parameters 
manually. The following screenshot shows the Holder  tab, where we can create the desired shape:
Figure 3.8: The Holder tab
As you can see, we can simply set Style  to Custom  to be able to set all the geometry specifications. 
Here, I have copied and pasted all the values from the shank; the 3D preview is now quite close to 
the real tool!
Note
Y ou don’t always have to specify the shank geometry; if you are sure that no collisions are going 
to occur, you only need to use the insert geometry!
Creating a new tool
 71
Setup
We do not have so much to modify on the Setup  tab:
Figure 3.9: The Setup tab
Here, we can set the shank rotation, also known as Orientation , but most of the time, we use 0° for 
external operations and 90° for internal operations.
We can also change  the Compensation  parameter, which allows us to shift the cutting origin of the 
tool (more on this in Chapter 10 ). However, for the sake of simplicity, let’s leave it set to Tip tangent  
(do not change it unless you know what you are doing!).
Cutting data
Cutting data  is one of the  most interesting tabs. Here, we can specify the default cutting parameters 
to use with this tool. However, it is not mandatory to insert these values – we can manually specify 
them later since, as we already know, parameters greatly change on different operations. We can set 
default cutting parameters if we already know that most of our machining with this tool will have 
similar geometries with similar cutting parameters.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 72
Now, let’s review the main options we can set:
Figure 3.10: The Cutting data tab
If our lathe can smoothly control rotation speed via an inverter, we can tick the Use constant rotation 
speed  option. With this option enabled, our lathe will automatically tweak the rotation speed to achieve 
a constant cutting speed. As already mentioned in Chapter 1 , the chuck will rotate faster when cutting 
on a smaller diameter and will spin slower when cutting on a bigger diameter. Also, you can use the 
Surface speed  option to set the default cutting speed for the tool.
Inside Feedrates , we can specify the default cutting feed for the tool. Two values to note are Lead-in 
feedrate  and Lead-out feedrate ; with these values, we can specify different feeds before engaging and 
after leaving the stock, respectively. Most of the time, unless we are looking at maximum productivity, 
we can use the same feed value for them all.
Under Passes and linking , you  can see an option called Depth of cut . If you want to calculate the 
cutting parameters, please always refer to the formulas shown in Chapter 1  (however, it is always  
a good practice to take a safety margin of at least 20-30% over the results of the formulas).
The last parameter to specify is the Coolant  method, which mostly depends on the machine and the 
material we want to cut. The default cooling method is Flood . With this type of cooling, our part is 
constantly sprayed with a lubricant coolant. This type of coolant is very effective since it allows us to 
drop cutting temperatures and enhance cutting performance.
As a rule of thumb, always cool your parts when machining. Cooling your part too much will never 
be a problem unless the material can absorb it (for example, wood)!
Creating a new tool
 73
Post processor
The last tab to mention  is the Post processor  tab. Inside this tab, we can help improve the post-processor 
results with a few features (if our machine supports them):
Figure 3.11: The Post processor tab
If our lathe can change tools automatically, we can specify where the tool is located inside the housing 
using Number . As shown in the preceding screenshot, at the moment, it has been set to be at position 
number 1. This means that our lathe, when changing tools automatically, will expect to find this tool 
inside housing number 1. We should always check the correct location inside the housing.
Another feature we can specify (if our lathe can manage it) is Break control . If we tick this option, 
before going forward with a new machining operation, our lathe will check whether the tool is in  
a good shape or whether it is broken.
If our lathe doesn’t have an  automatic tool change option, we should tick Manual tool change  and 
skip all the other parameters on this page.
And with that, we have analyzed most of the options available when creating a new tool inside Fusion 
360. However, for the lazy users among us, there are faster and more painless ways to get new tools: 
using third-party options.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 74
Importing a third-party tool library
Creating tools is  nice and cheap, but it can be a bit time-consuming if we need several new tools. 
Another option is to increase the built-in tool libraries by downloading third-party libraries and 
importing them inside Fusion 360.
So, how can we do that? First of all, we should enable cloud libraries. Y ou can find the Enable Cloud 
Libraries  option in the General  preferences area, under Manufacture . Once found, be sure to tick 
the box:
Figure 3.12: Manufacture preferences
This option will create a bridge between our tool library and our projects.
Importing a third-party tool library
 75
After this, we can download a new tool library. Y ou can find many libraries online; some of them 
require a subscription, and some just an account. For the sake of simplicity, we are going to use a 
sample tool library by nyccnc.com .
Once you have downloaded the attached file, unzip it. There should be a .json  file inside the archive. 
To import it into Fusion 360 libraries, we have to import it into the Assets  folder. This folder is located 
in the side panel of the project root:
Figure 3.13: The Assets folder
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 76
Once inside the Assets  folder, open the CAMTools  subfolder ( 1):
Figure 3.14: Import library
With CAMTools  open, click Upload  (2). Then, select the downloaded library ( 3) and click Upload  
to upload  the file ( 4).
Importing new tools with a plugin (CoroPlus)
 77
And that’s it. If we open the tool library again, we should find a few differences from before:
Figure 3.15: Finding the new tools
First of all, we should have noticed a new Cloud  section ( 1), under which we will find our new third-
party library ( 2). Y ou should also see several new tools listed ( 3); if we click on an element, we can 
find the tool preview ( 4) and the tool specifications ( 5) too.
At this point, we could move on to the next chapter since we already know how to add lots of tools 
to our library, but we would miss one very useful option: using a third-party plugin. This third way 
is definitely worth mentioning.
Importing new tools with a plugin (CoroPlus)
As you may expect, the limited turning tool library of Fusion 360 is a problem that we don’t have to 
face alone. As already discussed, several tool companies have created tool libraries for Fusion 360, but 
Sandvik Coromant has taken things to the next level, creating a plugin that has so much more to offer.
First of all, what is a plugin? A plugin  is an additional piece of software that gives the main software 
more features and commands. There is a plugin browser inside Fusion 360 – consider it like an app 
store – where we can look for new features to add.
The plugin we are about to discover is called CoroPlus, and we should consider it more like an advanced 
CAM module rather than a mere tool database. Not only do we have access to thousands of tools, but 
we can also use it to calculate cutting parameters and so much more.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 78
There are only two main drawbacks: it is licensed under a subscription and it has limited support for 
turning operations. However, Sandvik allows us to try the software for 30 days free of charge. It is a 
very good plugin and I think it is worth the cost, but if you still feel disoriented with turning, I invite 
you to give it a try later.
If you are not scared yet, let’s  review how to install this plugin and give it a try! First, you need to 
find the plugin browser; make sure that you are in the UTILITIES  tab ( 1). Then, open the ADD-INS  
subpanel, and launch Fusion 360 App Store  (2):
Figure 3.16: Plugin browser location
We can easily find the CoroPlus plugin by filtering for CAM plugins or by typing CoroPlus  in the 
search bar:
Figure 3.17: CoroPlus plugin
Importing new tools with a plugin (CoroPlus)
 79
Once located, select  the plugin and download it, making sure to choose the platform option compatible 
with your setup:
Figure 3.18: Plugin download
The installation process should be very straightforward – we only need to log in with our Autodesk 
account and follow the instructions on the screen!
So, the installation went smoothly, but how can we open our plugin? Y ou should be able to find the 
plugin inside the UTILITIES  tab, like so:
Figure 3.19: CoroPlus icon
However, if you can’t see it in the tab, you may need to load the plugin first. To do that, go back to the 
ADD-INS  menu and select the Scripts and Add-Ins…  option:
Figure 3.20: Add-ins startup
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 80
This command will open the following panel, which allows us to manage all the extensions and plugins 
(for example, if a plugin causes our project to keep crashing, we may disable it):
Figure 3.21: Add-ins management
To activate the new plugin, make sure that you are on the Add-Ins  tab, select the plugin’s name, and 
then hit Run . Please note that a good idea is to tick the Run on Startup  option to automatically load 
the plugin at startup.
We are now ready to launch the plugin and log in to our Sandvik account:
Importing new tools with a plugin (CoroPlus)
 81
Figure 3.22: CoroPlus login panel
Once we’ve logged in, we can unleash all its potential. Grasping all of the features that this plugin 
can offer is way beyond the scope of this book, so for now, we’ll just show you how to gain access to 
the tool library.
If we want to use a new tool, we have to create it from the Sandvik online database, save it to our local 
CoroPlus database, and then send it to the Fusion 360 library. It is quite a tricky process at first, so 
let’s find out how to do it.
As shown in the following screenshot, the first time we open the tool selection window, the interface 
is pretty much empty:
Figure 3.23: CoroPlus local database
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 82
There are no  tools to select here because we never downloaded any from the online database. Therefore, 
the first thing we need to do is create a new assembly for our tool. It is called an assembly because the 
insert and shank are combined together.
Y ou should now be presented with the following screen, where we can search for our tool using the 
Item type  tree or by using Add filters :
Figure 3.24: CoroPlus tool selection
As you can see, we have so many tools to search from, even after we have activated a few filters ( 1). 
Now, let’s suppose we have finally found the tool we need – we just have to select it ( 2) and click on 
Select item  (3). We should now be presented with the following screen:
Figure 3.25: CoroPlus tool edit
Summary
 83
Here, we can specify the tool’s name for future reference inside Fusion 360 and check all the details of 
the selected tool. Another nice feature to have is the 3D preview of the shank with the insert mounted; 
sometimes, we may get confused with all the geometry parameters, but I think that having a 3D preview 
of the tool can help us visually check whether we picked the tool we need.
Once we are sure that the tool is correct, we can click on Save  to get back to the CoroPlus local tool 
library, which should now no longer be empty:
Figure 3.26: CoroPlus tool select
As a final step, we just have to select our tool and click Send to Fusion 360 . Easy enough, isn’t it?
Please note that at the time of writing, CoroPlus is still not fully compatible with Fusion 360 turning 
operations – it works great for milling but the turning part is still a work in progress. Y ou should think 
twice before buying it if your main target is a lathe.
However, as we will find out in Chapter 4  and Chapter 5 , we can still use CoroPlus to calculate turning 
parameters, which is probably its best-selling feature.
After all that, we now understand how and where to find all the possible different tools that we may 
ever need for machining.
Summary
Congratulations! We have come to the end of this chapter. I hope that you feel a bit more confident 
about where and how to look for new tools to use.
Let’s quickly recap what we learned in this chapter. First, we discovered the built-in tool library and 
how to filter the tools to find what we needed. After, we learned three different ways to add more tools 
that we may need to machine our part, including how to create a new tool from scratch and how to 
import third-party libraries and plugins.
Discovering the Tool Library and Custom Tools 84
This is a beginner-level book, so there is not time enough to increase the level of detail on this subject; 
instead, I encourage you to dig more into important tool brand websites, where you will find a lot 
more that we were forced to leave untouched!
If you want to start spinning the chuck, please move on to the next chapter, where we are going to 
implement turning strategies to machine our first part!4
Implementing Our First  
Turning Operation
In this chapter, we will practice our first basic facing operation. Through doing this, we will discover 
how to get all the cutting parameters using the Sandvik CoroPlus plugin and how to import them 
inside Fusion 360. Plus, we will deeply analyze all the options available in this first Facing  command 
since most of them will occur on other types of machining as well.
After this, we will check how to simulate tool movements to check for collisions or other errors, and 
finally, we will take a fast look at how to generate G-code.
The goal of this chapter is to lay concrete bases for future setups. As we will discover, the same key 
concepts and commands are encountered over and over again throughout the MANUFACTURE  
environment; understanding the main commands and options for a basic feature will give us a solid 
ground for further developments.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Setting up a facing operation
• Discovering tool simulation
• Checking the generated G-code
Technical requirements
In this chapter, we are going to start from an existing setup (like the one created in Chapter 2 ), therefore 
you are supposed to have a stock and a WCS already set.
We are also going to use Sandvik CoroPlus to evaluate the cutting parameters faster without calculating 
all the values by hand; therefore, having a CoroPlus license might be a good idea. However, at the 
moment, you should already be able to roughly estimate all the values on your own.Implementing Our First Turning Operation 86
Setting up a facing operation
One of the first operations we always have to implement is part facing. Y ou may be wondering why. 
The reason is quite simple: we should always first perform those operations that will give us a true 
reference point for further operations or for measuring. Since, most of the time, the origin is on the 
front of the stock or the front of our part, a first facing operation will allow us to measure where the 
origin is located properly.
As you can see here, the origin is set to be on the front face of our stock:
Figure 4.1: Lack of reference on the stock face
However, since the stock is never precisely cut, we may have a bit of trouble trying to take measurements 
from the origin!
Let’s now suppose that we need to remove 3 millimeters  (mm) of material in front of the part from 
a low-alloy steel stock with a diameter of 55 mm:
Figure 4.2: Material to be removed
Setting up a facing operation
 87
At the moment, we will focus on facing the front side of our stock, while in Chapter 5 , we will take a 
look at the other turning operations to machine the rest of the part.
Now that we understand the operation that we have to implement first, we should take all of the formulas 
and use a calculator to find the cutting parameters we must use. Luckily there is a workaround that will 
save us lots of equations: if you are a bit lazy like me, we can “cheat” a little and use CoroPlus instead.
As already mentioned in Chapter 3 , CoroPlus not only gives us access to a wide range of tools but can 
also help us with parameter evaluation. In the next pages, we will find how to use CoroPlus at this scope.
Using CoroPlus to calculate cutting parameters
Let’s just open CoroPlus and set our first facing operation step by step. Having opened CoroPlus, we 
should be presented with the following selection screen:
Figure 4.3: Operation type
As you  can see, the interface is simple, and it helps us in the selection process. It is quite intuitive since 
it graphically shows the operations we can set up. Inside the first selection window ( COMPONENT ) 
we can choose between Symmetrical rotating  (turning) and Non rotating  (milling). Let’s click on 
Symmetrical rotating .
We should now be taken to a second selection window that is specific for turning operations only. Of 
course, the more we move forward with selections, the more the operation-type range will narrow 
until there is only one left:
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 88
Figure 4.4: Turning operation
As you can see from the screenshot, this second selection window is called SYMMETRICAL 
ROTATING , and here, we find turning operations only. We can still choose between a great variety 
of turning operations (we already described most of these in detail  in the first chapter, so we will skip 
a recap and focus on our facing example).
Facing is an  external operation; therefore, we have to click on External . This will lead us to a third 
and final  selection window, EXTERNAL , where we can choose between all the external operations:
Figure 4.5: External turning operations
We should have already spotted what we need; just click on Facing of bar  to quit the selection interface 
and start with the parameters calculator.
Setting up a facing operation
 89
This will allow us to set all the boundary conditions and will calculate the cutting parameters we need 
in just a few clicks:
Figure 4.6: Boundary conditions
As you can  see, we can specify all the parameters found in the cutting power formula. Please note 
that almost no parameter is mandatory, but the more we specify, the better the result; let’s look at the 
most important ones:
1. Machined diameter start : This is the outer diameter of the part we need to face; in our case, 
the stock is 55 mm.
2. General width parameter : This is the distance between the front of the stock and the front of 
the part; in our case, it is 3 mm.
3.   roughness value : This is the desired roughness; smaller values will result in smoother and 
shinier surfaces, while bigger values will result in rougher surfaces. If we suppose that our 
example face has to be smooth and shiny, then we should set roughness to 0.8 µm (microns); 
this is quite a small roughness. Choosing between a higher or a lower roughness depends on 
the usage of the machined part; we should never target a shiny face if not really needed because 
a smaller roughness doesn’t come for free—the part will be more expensive and longer to machine.
4. Rotational speed maximum : This value is the maximum RPMs achievable by our lathe. It is 
not mandatory to specify but it is still an important parameter to set since it will influence our 
cutting speed. I plan to machine the example part on a HAAS ST-25  lathe model. Its maximum 
rotation speed is 4000  RPM; therefore, I should not exceed this limit on the settings.
5. Stock material : Here, we can specify the material we want to machine. Please note that different 
materials such as steel or aluminum will have totally different cutting values, so be sure that you 
don’t skip this setting. In our case, as already mentioned, the example part will be machined 
out of a low-alloy steel stock.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 90
6. Machine information : Here, we can set the size and the power of our lathe so that CoroPlus 
won’t exceed its limits while calculating cutting parameters. In the example, my machine has 
a cutting power of around 25 kilowatts  (kW); therefore, I set the power accordingly.
After we set all the  information, we can click Get results  to get the best cutting parameters that fit 
our current scenario. In the following screenshot, we can find the suggested cutting parameters for 
our facing:
Figure 4.7: CoroPlus results
This  screenshot is quite dense with  useful information, but  let’s review the most interesting parts:
1. Suggested tool  and Suggested shank : CoroPlus will evaluate which is the best machining solution 
according to productivity and costs. If we don’t like the first proposed result, we can move to 
the next, even if it may be less optimized. As you can see, CoroPlus recommends that we use 
a round insert both for roughing and for finishing. The suggested ISO code is RCMT1606M .
Setting up a facing operation
 91
2. Tool life count : This is the number of machined parts we can obtain with a single insert. As 
you can see, at the current cutting parameters, our tool will last for 362 parts before wearing 
too much or breaking. This is an important value we can use for cost evaluation.
3. Machining time : The time spent on the facing operations. The estimated duration for the 
machining is around 3 seconds. This piece of information is very handy for cost evaluation as well.
4. PREMACHINING : Here, we can find all the parameters of our first roughing passes. As you 
can see, CoroPlus is suggesting we perform two passes at a cutting depth of 1.02 mm and a 
feed step of 0.491 mm per revolution  (mm/rev ). The suggested cutting speed is 356 meters 
per minute  (m/min ).
5. FINISHING : After the first roughing passes, CoroPlus is suggesting we perform one final 
finishing pass to get the right surface quality. As you can see, this final cutting pass is performed 
using different parameters that will cut slower but will result in a better surface finish. For this 
pass, the cutting feed is set to 0.265 mm/rev , and the cutting depth is now set to 0.96 mm, 
while the suggested cutting speed also changed to 415 m/min .
I hope that you now better understand the potential of this plugin; as we discovered, with a few clicks, 
not only could we define every piece of information needed to set up our operation but we also got 
important data to estimate the final part cost.
It is now time to take all these results and bring them into Fusion 360.
Entering the cutting parameters into Fusion 360
Getting all the required parameters for our first facing was not that hard, was it? Now, all we have to 
do is copy and  paste all the provided parameters into Fusion 360.
First of all, where do we find the Facing  command? If you cannot find it, be sure to be inside the 
MANUFACTURE  module ( 1), look under the TURNING  tab ( 2), and there it is:Implementing Our First Turning Operation 92
Figure 4.8: Facing location
Inside this  panel, we can also find all the other turning strategies:
Figure 4.9: Turning operations drop-down menu
Setting up a facing operation
 93
We will explore all of these in Chapter 5 , but for now, we are focused on facing, so please click on 
Turning Face  to open the FACE  panel where we can specify all the settings. There are several tabs to 
look at, so let’s go through them one by one.
Tool tab
The To ol  tab is  one of the most important tabs for any CAM operation. Here is where we have to set 
the tool to use and some of its cutting parameters. There are many options to manage:
Figure 4.10: Facing’s Tool tab
As you  can imagine, we already have all the information needed to fulfill this tab, so just copy and 
paste the information from the CoroPlus results; let’s look at some of the important options:
1. To ol : Here, we set the tool we want to use. In the previous pages, we found that CoroPlus 
suggested we use an insert with the following ISO code: RCMT1606M0 . As we discovered in 
Chapter 3 , there are several ways to create an insert from scratch or to import it from external 
sources; therefore, we will skip tool creation.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 94
2. Tool Orientation : As with most external turning operations, we leave it as 0 deg .
3. Use Constant Surface Speed : With this option (if supported), we can let the lathe adjust RPMs 
automatically while facing. As we should remember from what was found in Chapter 1 , at a 
constant chuck rotation, the cutting speed will drop closer to the rotation axis. With this option, 
our chuck will spin faster when cutting closer to the center.
4. Cutting Feed per Revolution : Here, we simply paste the resulting value from CoroPlus, which 
is 0.491 . Please note that we don’t have a set cutting depth yet; however, we will do that when 
we look at the Passes  tab shortly.
We now set everything needed for our tool, so we can move to the next tab: Geometry .
Geometry tab
Inside  the Geometry  tab, there are commands to set the target plane to machine on our facing:
Figure 4.11: Facing’s Geometry tab
Since facing is a relatively simple operation, there isn’t much we have to set on this tab:
1. Front Mode : With this option, we can decide which plane we want to face. In our example, we 
need to remove all the stock from the front of our part, so we will just leave the default value 
as Model front ; this means that our tool will remove material until it touches the front face 
of our part. If we had to face other planes, we may decide to choose Selection  from the same 
drop-down menu instead.
2. Offset : This is a value to shift the Front  plane along the z axis. For example, if we want to leave 
a certain thickness of material above our model face, we can add a positive value. As you can 
see from the following screenshot, after setting a value of 1.5 mm as the offset, there is a bit of 
stock left on the front of our part:
Setting up a facing operation
 95
Figure 4.12: Facing tool’s front offset
Note
Why does our label display an offset of -1.5 mm  while on the command we wrote 1.5 mm? 
Very simple: the origin is in the front of our stock, so any front offset value will be negative!
Since we plan to set up one roughing operation with two passes of 1.02 mm and one finishing 
pass of 0.96 mm, we may set an offset of 0.96  mm on the first facing and an offset of 0 on the 
second facing. In such a scenario, we have to create two distinct facing operations one after 
the other; however, there are other ways to leave stock around our part for future passes, so 
let’s set the offset back to 0 for now.
This was all you had to know about the Geometry  tab. Let’s now review the third tab related to radial 
coordinates, called Radii .
Radii tab
This tab is  very easy to understand but also very important since it manages the safety positions for 
our tool; we will find it on any CAM operation.
Note
With milling operations, this tab will be called Heights , but the idea behind it and its usage is 
the same as what we are about to discuss.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 96
Up until now, we already defined notable coordinates along the z axis only. For example, you may 
recall that we discussed the Safe Z  plane, the Chuck  plane, and the Front  plane; those are coordinates 
on the z axis that specify where our tool is likely to collide with the stock or with the chuck (all those 
planes were set in Chapter 2 ).
With the Radii  panel, we can specify notable planes on the radial coordinate instead. Those planes 
can control, for example, where the tool will retract or how deep the tool will cut. We are about to 
check all those planes, so don’t worry if it sounds a bit weird for now.
Please note that—to tell you the truth—due to cylindrical coordinates’ behavior, those coordinates 
do not define planes but rather cylindrical surfaces around the rotation axis.
Let’s now check the tab itself:
Figure 4.13: Facing’s Radii tab
These are the radii we have to work with:
• Clearance : The position our tool will move to before and after the operation we are creating. It 
will be a position where our tool is always safe to retract. Usually, it is the outermost position 
our tool can assume during our operation.
Setting up a facing operation
 97
• Retract : As mentioned in Chapter 1 , between cutting passes, we always need to detach our 
tooltip from the machined surface (to avoid rubbing) and reposition it for the next pass. With 
Retract , we can specify how far our tool will be detached from the machined surface. The 
retract range can be set from less than 1 mm all the way up to the clearance coordinate. For 
extra safety, we may decide to retract our tool after every pass up to the clearance coordinate, 
but this will only waste time. We usually can just set the tool to retract just a few mm above 
an already machined surface.
• Outer Radius : This is the outermost position our tool will take while cutting. It doesn’t have 
to coincide with our part’s outer diameter. For example, what if our stock (which should have 
an outer diameter of 50 mm) is a bit bigger? We may need to increase the outer radius to be 
machined to be sure to approach our part correctly.
• Inner Radius : This is the innermost position our tool will take while machining. For example, 
if machining a pipe, there is no reason to let the tool move up until the rotation axis because 
there is no material to remove there.
We can set the location of all the planes we just reviewed by simply clicking on the From  drop-down menu:
Figure 4.14: Radii selection
As you can see, there are several options to introduce; we are going to mention them all, but they are 
not difficult to understand:
• Clearance : This is a reference to the clearance coordinate (this option won’t be available while 
defining the clearance, of course).
• Retract : This is a reference to the retract coordinate (this option won’t be available while 
defining the retract position).
• Stock OD : This is a reference to the outer diameter of our stock.
• Model OD : This is a reference to the outer diameter of our model.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 98
• Model ID : This is a reference to the inner diameter of our model. If our model is not a tube, 
this must be 0.
• Stock ID : This is a reference to the stock’s inner diameter if the stock is hollow or a pipe. If it 
is not hollow, this value must be 0.
• Selection : This is a surface we can select.
• Radius : We can specify a radius by typing a value.
• Diameter : We can specify a diameter by typing a value.
Now that we have reviewed all the available options of the Radii  tab, we can now try to understand 
what the settings of Figure 4.13  mean. Inner Radius  is set to 0 since the stock is not hollow, and we 
need to machine it up until the rotation axis. Then, Outer Radius  is set to 0 too, so the outer stock and 
outer working position are the same (most of the time, you may want to have a slightly bigger working 
position to compensate for minor errors in the stock). Retract  is set to be at 5 mm; this means that 
after a cutting pass, the tool will move 5 mm away from the stock's outer radius. Finally, Clearance  
is set to be 10 mm outward from the retract position.
We can check a 3D view as well to find all these radii set. As you can see, all these positions are 
highlighted with the corresponding radial coordinate:
Figure 4.15: Radii position
After reviewing all the key radial positions, we can now move to one of the most important tabs: Passes .
Setting up a facing operation
 99
Passes tab
Inside the Passes  tab, not only can we manage all the parameters that regulate the depth of cutting 
and the number of passes but we can also set the parameters for roughing passes and finishing passes:
Figure 4.16: Facing’s Passes tab
As you may  imagine, it is quite dense in content, so let’s review it step by step:
1. Tolerance : With this value, we can  set the discretization  of complex profiles. Here, we will keep 
the default value, which is 0.01 mm ; this is fine most of the time, but if you find a segmented 
shape on your machined part, you may want to reduce this value. Please be careful with this 
parameter since a direct consequence of a smaller discretization is that a curved toolpath will 
be described with more points. As a rule of thumb, a 10 times smaller tolerance will lead to 
10 times as many points. Each point must be described with a set of coordinates; therefore, 
the output G-code file may be 10 times bigger. With an unnecessarily small tolerance, we may 
get a file size of gigabytes  (GB) instead of kilobytes  (KB), and this will slow down the entire 
process due to limited memory!
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 100
Note
What is discretization? It is a process where we approximate a curve to a set of segments. The 
smaller the tolerance, the better the approximation and the higher the number of segments 
created. Something very similar will be covered in Chapter 17  when dealing with tessellation.
2. Use Reduced Feed : With this option, we can specify a smaller feed once the machining  operation 
is approaching its end. Most of the time, it is used when cutting a part from the stock; that’s 
because once the diameter is getting smaller and smaller, the part may start vibrating too much 
at a high feed rate. In any other scenario, this is something you will rarely have to set. For now, 
we can leave it unchecked, but we will cover this parameter again in Chapter 5 .
3. Compensation Type : This is the option to shift the tool’s origin. We already discussed this 
when talking about the Setup  command’s Post Process  tab in Chapter 2 . As told before, it is 
a bit beyond the scope of this book, but for now, do not change the default value unless you 
know what you are doing.
4. Multiple Passes : Here, we can specify to Fusion 360 whether we want a single pass or multiple 
passes. As we already know, for this example part, we plan to perform two roughing passes and 
a single finishing pass, so we must check this option.
5. Calculate Number of Stepovers : With this option checked, Fusion 360 will try to calculate the 
number of passes required to machine our part. At the moment, we already know the number 
of passes and every depth of cut, so we will leave this option unchecked.
6. Number of Stepovers  (for roughing passes): Here, we can specify how many roughing passes 
we want to generate; in the example, we will set it to 2.
7. Stepover  (for roughing passes): With this option, we can set the depth of cut of every roughing 
pass. For our example, CoroPlus suggested we set it to 1.02 mm  while roughing.
8. Finishing Passes : By checking this box, we can specify to Fusion 360 that we want finishing 
passes to have a better surface quality. This is something we need, as suggested by CoroPlus.
9. Number of stepovers  (for finishing passes): Here, we can specify how many finishing passes  
we want to perform. In the example, we will have just 1 pass.
10. Stepover  (for finishing passes): This value is the cutting depth while performing finishing 
passes. At the moment, we will set it to 0.96 mm .
11. Finish Feedrate : As you remember, we already set the main feed rate for this facing operation 
on the To ol  tab. However, finishing passes always require a different feed, so here we can specify 
the finishing feed value suggested by CoroPlus: 0.265 mm/rev .
12. Repeat Finishing Pass : As the name suggests, with this option checked, we can repeat another 
finishing pass that will move along the same toolpath as the first finishing pass. It is mostly used 
to compensate for part bending; if the part bends, our tool cannot remove the right amount 
of material because the stock doesn’t have the expected shape—therefore, a second identical 
finishing pass can help remove the bit of material that remained.Setting up a facing operation
 101
13. Stock to Leave : If you check this option, you’ll be able to specify the amount of material to 
leave above the machined part. Such an option is most useful when you plan to set two different 
operations: one for roughing and one for finishing.
Finally, we have completed the Passes  tab. There is one more tab available called Linking , which is 
used for performance optimization and to regulate how the tool moves between passes. However, this 
tab is a bit too advanced, and most of the time, you can leave it with default values (unless looking for 
maximum performance), so for the sake of simplicity, we have to skip this section entirely.
After all of those options, we should now have something like this on our screen:
Figure 4.17: Facing complete
As you can see, we have a few lines that describe the toolpath we set with this facing operation:
1. The red arrow is the entry point while the green arrow is the exit point; these points are set on 
the clearance coordinate and are the first and the last points assumed by our tool.
2. The vertical blue lines are the cutting passes. As you should recall, our facing operation was 
set with two roughing passes and one final finishing pass. In the screenshot, there are two blue 
lines detached from the part front, which are the two roughing passes we set. The distance 
between the lines is the cutting depth, which for our example was 1.02 mm.
3. This vertical blue line is hard to spot, but it is the finishing pass on the front face of our model.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 102
4. These points are on the retract coordinate where our tool moves after every pass (unless 
otherwise set on the Linking  tab).
5. This is the remaining stock after this facing operation. As you can see, it no longer protrudes 
3 mm from the front of our model.
Congratulations—we just finished our first turning operation!
If you feel a little bored while looking at segments on the screen displaying tool movements, then you 
are not alone. Fortunately, in the next section, we will find out how to simulate our tool and toolpath 
for real.
Discovering tool simulation
What is tool simulation ? The short answer is very simple: it is a procedure where we check whether 
the result of a turning operation we just set is giving the attended results or not.
In the most ideal scenario, it is just a command that confirms that we are great machinists and that no 
errors are happening. However, sometimes, we may discover that we still have to tune the operations 
a little bit more.
While watching the toolpath, we should always check for these four errors:
1. Tool and shank collisions with the chuck or with the stock
2. Entry and exit points located in unsafe areas
3. Tool trying to machine an already machined area
4. Difference between the intended result and the simulated result
It seems that there are so many things that could go in the wrong way that we need to check from 
our toolpath. Luckily, there is quite a handy tool that takes a great part of the effort. We are about to 
discover this tool.
Let’s start by launching the Simulate  command:
Figure 4.18: Simulate command
Discovering tool simulation
 103
Now, we  should be presented with the following screen that contains all the information we need 
to analyze:
Figure 4.19: Simulate interface
Let’s review the most important elements:
1. SIMULATE panel : Here, we find lots of options that allow us to tweak the visual appearance 
of the simulation and get useful data for cost evaluation and tool usage. We will dig deeper 
into these panels in just a moment.
2. Current operation : This is  the operation that we are simulating; we may decide to simulate  
a single operation or the entire setup.
3. Stock : This is the stock that we are just about to simulate.
4. To ol : This  is the tool we used for our first facing operation at its entry location.
5. Progress bar : At the bottom of the screen, you may find a bar representing the current progress of 
the simulation. Y ou can consider it as the progress bar found on any Y ouTube video or any music 
player, but showing how much of the cutting is done and how much still has to be completed.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 104
6. Simulation controls : Just as with any video player, we can start, stop, and rewind the simulation. 
If we click on the Play  button, the tool will move and will start machining our part following 
the generated toolpath.
7. Speed cursor : Since some operations may be very slow, with this cursor, we can increase their 
speed for visualization purposes.
Just press the Play  button to check  the simulated result:
Figure 4.20: Simulation result
As we can find from the screenshot, we can see the transparent stock machined up to the front face 
of our part and the round insert located on the end of our path. Everything is working as expected!
.Discovering tool simulation
 105
Let’s now review the main SIMULATE  panel a bit closer. The first tab is called Display ; here, we can 
find all the options related to what’s visible and what’s not during the simulation:
Figure 4.21: SIMULATE panel
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 106
As you may expect, there are many settings available, but luckily, most of them are very intuitive; here, 
we will just have to check the most important ones:
1. To ol : With this option, we can show the tool and its holder while simulating the machining 
operation (you should always enable this option!).
2. Programmed Point : With this option, we can display a dot on the simulation tool to show where 
the origin of the tool itself is located. Note that we can shift this point with the Compensation  
parameter that we mentioned in Chapter 3  while creating a new tool. During that first encounter, 
I suggested leaving this point on the tooltip; therefore, we should now find the dot placed on 
the tip of our tool.
3. To olp ath : Here, we can decide to display the toolpath as a group of lines on the screen; I strongly 
recommend leaving this box checked.
4. Mode : With  this option, we can decide to display toolpath lines during the entire simulation, only 
after the simulation is completed, or only before. I always leave this option as All toolpath . Basically, 
changing this parameter will display or hide the tool movements set on the previous option.
5. Stock : Enabling this option will display the stock being machined (this is the best part of the 
simulation since it is very useful but also very satisfying, in my opinion!).
6. Colorization : This dialog box allows us to specify how to set colors on the machined faces 
during simulation; for example, we may have a different color for every different tool used or 
we can have a different color for each operation.
7. Accuracy : Tool simulations work with 3D meshes to simulate machined shapes. Meshes are a 
type of 3D model composed of multiple triangles that approximates the ideal shape. Y ou can 
consider the Accuracy  parameter as the resolution of these meshes (intended as the triangle’s 
density). The smaller those triangles, the higher the detail, but also the heavier the computational 
task for our computer. If you want smaller meshes, you can move the cursor to the right. Most 
of the time, however, you can confidently use the default value.
8. Transparent : With this option, we can have a transparent stock with the part to be machined 
inside it. We should always check this option because it allows us to constantly check both the 
part and the stock.
9. Stop on collision : This is the most important option of our simulation, as when checked 
while simulating, if our tool is colliding with something else, it will immediately stop the 
simulation and highlight with red the faces that collided. Please note that we may also find 
minor collisions—some that are hard to spot in other ways; for example, our tool trying to cut 
a bit beyond its cutting-edge length.Discovering tool simulation
 107
We can now move  to the next tab called Info ; here, we can find all the most important pieces of 
information on tool position and operation state during the simulation:
Figure 4.22: Info tab
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 108
This panel replicates somehow the display or our CNC machine. We will now review the most 
important points:
1. Position : Here, we can find the current position of our tool during the simulation process.
2. Spindle speed : This shows the current simulated rotation speed of the chuck.
3. Feedrate : This value is the current feed set on the current movement. At the moment, as we 
can see, it is set to Rapid ; this is not a numeric value, just the maximum speed our machine 
can move.
Note
When do we use rapid movement? This is when we need to move our tool from point A to 
point B in the fastest way possible—for example, between longitudinal passes (when the tool 
is moving in the safe retraction area). Rapid movements are never used for cutting purposes 
since when cutting we have to carefully set the values, considering all the other parameters.
4. Operation : Under  this subpanel, we can find all the pieces of information related to the type 
of machining operation and the tool used.
5. Work offset : This is a reference to the work offset number we set in Chapter 2 . It is somewhat 
difficult to explain, but in short, it is a way to override the default WCS. As you may recall, we 
simply left the default value of 0.
6. Collisions : This is the total number of collisions encountered up to this point while simulating; 
it should always be 0.
7. Volume : Here, we can find the mass that will be converted to chip; this is very useful for checking 
waste material and monitoring costs.
Nice—this tab gave us many useful pieces of information. There is one more tab called Statistics  to check:
Figure 4.23: Statistics tab
Discovering tool simulation
 109
As you can see from the screenshot, here, we can find information related to the total time taken for the 
machining operations, the total distance covered by our tool, and information related to the number 
of operations simulated and the number of tool changes with the simulated operations.
Now that we have gone through a full review of the options, we can analyze our simulation results 
and try to understand whether everything is working fine. As already mentioned, we should answer 
the following four questions:
1. Are there collisions?  As found in Figure 4.22 , the simulation gave us a collision count of 0. 
Therefore, the most important test is passed!
2. Are entry and exit points located in a safe area?  From Figure 4.20 , we can tell that the entry 
and exit points are located far away from the chuck and from the stock. This test is also passed!
3. Is the tool trying to cut an already machined area?  To answer this question, we just have 
to visually check the toolpath or tool movements during a simulation replay. In the following 
screenshot, I simply stopped the simulation while running the first roughing pass:
Figure 4.24: Simulation in progress
As you can see, all the blue lines are inside the stock ( 1), therefore no cutting movements are 
wasted cutting air. Also, we can find that the stock is gradually changing shape ( 2), and we can 
spot the nose radius being impressed on the stock being machined.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 110
4. Is the resulting shape correct?  This is the simplest question to answer—we can simply check 
the resulting colors!
Figure 4.25: Colors
As we can find from the screenshot, the front face of our part is now green, meaning  that 
no extra material is present (it would have been blue) and that we haven’t overmachined the 
geometry, removing too much stock (the color would have been red).
Now, we can be confident that our toolpath is set correctly and that it shouldn’t cause any trouble to 
our lathe or our stock.
Finally, we can focus on converting the machining operations into actual G-code that our machine 
can understand.
Checking the generated G-code
As you may  recall, after setting up all our operations with Fusion 360, we need a postprocessor to 
generate a file containing instructions that can be read and used by our machine. This set of instructions 
is called G-code, and every machine may speak a slightly different dialect of G-code.
Checking the generated G-code
 111
Note
I would like to highlight the fact that there are hundreds of different postprocessors, each operating 
with different options and giving different outputs. For this reason, it is impossible to take a 
deep look at the postprocessing world in the following pages; this would require several books 
on this subject alone. If you need to understand more about the translation process, I can only 
suggest you look at the machine documentation or postprocessor developers’ documentation.
First of all, we need to launch the Post Process  command, which you can  find here:
Figure 4.26: Post Process button
After launching the command, we should be presented with a window composed of two subpanels:
• Settings
• Operations
Let’s look at these two panels.
Settings
Settings  is the most important and complex panel, where we can specify all the needed information 
to prepare G-code compatible with our machine:
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 112
Figure 4.27: Post Process settings
As you can see from the  screenshot, there are several interesting options:
1. Post : This is the postprocessor that we decided to use. There is a pretty huge list of supported 
CNC models inside Fusion 360, but in this example, we are going to machine our part on an 
ST-25 lathe made by HAAS. Therefore, we click on the drop-down menu until we find the 
right postprocessor.
2. File name : This is the filename of the generated G-code file that we will send to our CNC machine.
3. Comment : Here, we can specify comments to add to the G-code file. We can add whatever phrase 
we want—for example, we may use a reference to the part name, its cost, or the author’s name.
4. Output folder : This is the file path where we are about to save the G-code file.
Checking the generated G-code
 113
5. NC extension : This is the G-code file extension (note that not every file has the same extension—it 
may be .gcode  or .nc , it may be extensionless, or something else; it depends on your machine).
6. Open NC file in editor : With this option, once the G-code file has been exported, it will be 
opened automatically.
7. Post properties : Here, you will find lots of options related to the postprocessor you chose. We 
must skip this part entirely since it is so largely dependent on the machine and its postprocessor.
This is all we had to know about this first panel, so we can now move to the following one.
Operations
Inside the Operations  panel, we get a recap of the operations we are about to translate into G-code:
Figure 4.28: Post Process Operations panel
What should we check?
1. Setup : This is the setup we are about to translate into G-code; since we may have multiple 
setups available, we should always check that we are exporting the intended one. As you can 
see, we can also uncheck machining operations in order to suppress them on G-code output.
2. To ol : Here, we can check that the operation is performed using the intended tool.
3. Work Offset : This is the work offset reference. Up until now, we found this parameter  several 
times and always ignored it; we will discuss it while talking about milling operations. For now, 
let’s check that the value is 0 so that no WCS override is taking place.
4. Reorder to Minimize Tool Changes : With this option, we can try to rearrange operations 
according to the tool used. This is nice to have, but if you really want to optimize machining 
time, I suggest you don’t use this option but set a proper working order instead.
Implementing Our First Turning Operation 114
Once we are ready, we can click on Post  to create our first G-code file. Let’s take a look at the result:
Figure 4.29: G-code
As you can see, the  operation that we set up inside Fusion 360 was just converted into G-code that can 
be used by our machine. Most of the numbers may be hard to understand, but we should try to learn 
at least the main commands and their effects on the machining process. This may be a challenging 
task but it will come in handy for future G-code troubleshooting.
Summary
 115
If you want to explore this new world of G-code and its functions, the following link is a great starting 
point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code .
Once again, I’ d like  to highlight the fact that the generated G-code is highly dependent on your CNC 
and on the postprocessor you use. Therefore, not all commands may be available, and they may not 
produce the same result!
Congratulations! We finally completed our first facing operation and exported G-code for our  
CNC—not bad at all! Let’s now recap what we have discovered during this chapter.
Summary
At first, we discovered why it is so important to start with a facing operation, then, using Sandvik 
CoroPlus, we could get all the cutting parameters to implement.
After this introduction, we deeply described all the options for the Facing  command. This is very 
important because, as we are about to discover, there are many other turning and milling strategies 
that we will implement to machine our part, but they will all look and work in the same way.
Once we completed our first operation, we discovered how to simulate our tool and how to check for 
errors; since we couldn’t spot any, we moved forward with postprocessing up to the G-code generation.
It is fair to say that all the efforts we spent on these pages on such a simple facing operation will be 
worth it time and time again.
Now that we’ve got an idea of a typical workflow with CAM operations, we can move forward with 
more complex machining strategies.
In the next chapter, we will keep machining the same example part until its completion. We will 
discover a bunch of different turning strategies that will allow us to take care of almost any possible 
shape turnable with a lathe, along with covering longitudinal roughing, contouring finish, threading, 
drilling, grooving, and parting. As you may imagine, the next chapter will be hugely important!5
Discovering More  
Turning Strategies
In this chapter, we will review the most important turning operations available in Fusion 360, in order 
to implement all the machining needed to complete a somewhat complex design with several different 
features to be machined. The part we are about to use as an example may look not so difficult, but 
actually, it hides several challenges to overcome.
Studying this chapter is very important, as we will introduce several new turning operations, which 
should enable us to machine 99% of the parts we encounter.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Turning Profile (Roughing)
• Turning Profile (Finishing)
• Turning Threads
• Drilling
• Turning Groove
• Turning Part
Technical requirements
The main requirement is you need to have read and, for the most part, understood all the previous 
chapters since we won’t explain subjects that we have already dealt with.
Also, as before, we are going to use Sandvik CoroPlus to evaluate the cutting parameters and speed 
up the process; however, CoroPlus is not strictly needed; for the following pages, you can simply copy 
the same cutting parameters used in the book.Discovering More Turning Strategies 118
In this chapter, we will continue with the work we did in Chapter 4 ; therefore, you should have the 
same setup ready with the facing operation already set.
We will machine the following features out of a stock with a diameter of 55 mm to complete the 
example part. In the following diagram, you will find all the dimensions you need to define every 
geometry detail necessary inside the design environment:
Figure 5.1: Part dimensions
From the diagram, we can spot quite a complex geometry. There is a diameter change at a sloped 
angle (120°) with R2 fillets, an external thread M42x4.5, and an internal hole with a diameter of 16 
mm. There is a groove for a circlip ring, and there are two chamfered edges, 2x45°, one on the front 
of the part, and one on the rear.
It is now time to start implementing machining operations.
Turning Profile (Roughing)
After the first  facing operation we implemented in Chapter 4 , we should start by setting up a roughing 
operation to remove most of the material from the stock. One of the best commands for roughing our 
part is called Turning Profile Roughing  and can be found among all the other turning commands:
Turning Profile (Roughing)
 119
Figure 5.2: Turning Profile Roughing
This turning operation will generate longitudinal passes, and it is useful to use when removing high 
amounts of material with powerful tools operating at a high cutting power. Before clicking on the 
command icon, we will choose the cutting tool we plan to use.
For this roughing operation, I decided to use the following ISO-coded insert: CNMG160616 .
Note
Why did I choose to use this tool ( CNMG160616 )? Because it is good for both roughing and 
finishing, and most importantly, it doesn’t have accessibility issues like the round insert we 
used for facing.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 120
The insert  will be installed on the following shank I created:
Figure 5.3: Tool Shank
For now, you  can simply copy and paste the values in order to follow the example operation. Now that 
we have a proper tool at our disposal in the tool library, we can start the Turning Profile Roughing  
command. We should now be presented with the typical panel with multiple tabs where we can specify 
all the cutting settings.
The Tool tab
Inside the To ol  tab are the options that allow us to choose the cutting tool and its cutting parameters:
Turning Profile (Roughing)
 121
Figure 5.4: The Roughing Tool tab
This tab is very  easy to understand, and you may have noticed that Surface Speed  should be set to 
279 m/min , Maximum Spindle Speed  to 4000 rpm , and Cutting Feed per Revolution  to 0.5 mm . 
All these values were calculated using CoroPlus.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 122
Let’s now focus on a few new options available inside this first panel (labeled in Figure 5.4):
1. Turning Mode : With this option, we can specify whether it is an internal or an external turning 
operation; in our case, we need to pick Outside profiling .
2. Tool Clearance Back : This option allows us to cheat Fusion 360 and let it think the tool has a 
bigger nose angle than in reality, increasing the auxiliary flank angle. This is used to produce 
a safety margin and avoid rubbing against the part.
3. Tool Clearance Front : This is very similar to the previous option, but instead of specifying 
a bigger angle on the auxiliary flank, here, we can set an increased angle on the main flank.
If you feel a bit confused about additional clearance angles, we can check them in the following diagram:
Figure 5.5: Clearance angles
As you can see, both options increase the nose angle; however, Clearance Front  increases the nose 
angle by rotating the main flank, while Clearance Back  increases the nose angle by rotating the 
auxiliary flank of the insert. Since the faces we are machining are not very deep and don’t have a 
complex profile, we can leave the default value of 0 degrees on both. A value of 0 won’t have any effect 
on toolpath generation.
Turning Profile (Roughing)
 123
The Geometry tab
Inside this tab, we can  specify the boundaries for our machining operation.
Figure 5.6: The Roughing Geometry tab
Only faces inside the specified boundaries will be considered for toolpath generation, while everything 
else won’t be machined. The main goal of this panel is to set the position of the two boundary planes called 
Front  (1) and Back  (2). As you can see from the screenshot, we can set the position manually by dragging 
the two planes directly from the 3D view or by specifying the parameters inside the drop-down menus.
Note
It may be a good idea to increase the machined length on the back a little bit if you plan to cut 
the part from the chuck.
Just a couple of things here to notice. We will machine the groove later with a dedicated operation, 
so we can remove all those faces with Groove Suppression  (3). With this option, Fusion 360 won’t 
calculate them when generating the toolpath.
Also, since this is not the  first operation of the setup, we must tick Rest Machining  (4). With this option 
ticked, the tool will be aware of areas that have already been machined by previous operations, and it 
will skip additional machining. In the example, we already machined the front side of our model, so 
there is no need to machine it again!
Discovering More Turning Strategies 124
The Passes tab
As the name might suggest, inside this tab, we can specify details that will tweak the cutting passes of 
the turning operation. This tab is one of the most important since, as we are about to discover, it can 
drastically change the cutting strategy:
Figure 5.7: The Roughing Passes tab
Turning Profile (Roughing)
 125
Inside this tab, we can specify the depth of cut and set additional stock to leave around our shape, 
but there are also a couple of interesting settings we should review in detail (labeled in Figure 5.7):
1. Cycle : With this option, we can specify whether the tool should cut in horizontal passes or in 
radial passes (such as when facing). Most of the time, we want Horizontal passes .
2. Direction : This is used to specify the direction of our tool when cutting. For example, it may cut 
while getting closer to the chuck ( Front to back ) or while moving away from it ( Back to front ). 
We can also specify to cut Both ways . Note that you have to choose the direction according 
to your tool and shank shape; setting the wrong cutting direction may cause stock collisions.
3. Even Depths of Cut : With this option, we force Fusion 360 to use, as much as possible, a constant 
cutting depth. Even depths of cut are typically used for a constant cutting edge engagement 
when performing several roughing passes. In our example, we just need one pass where the 
diameter is bigger and two passes where the diameter is smaller; therefore, we can leave the 
option unticked.
4. Use Pecking : With this box ticked, our tool will cut a bit in the forward direction, then it will 
move backward and then forward again. This option is mostly used as a chip-breaking strategy, 
which we don’t have to implement here.
As you may have noticed, I decided to leave 0.2 mm  of stock around my part since I plan to add an 
additional finishing pass to the part. The value of Maximum Depth of Cut  is set at 4.82 mm , and it 
was calculated using CoroPlus. For our example, we can leave everything else on the default settings.
This is all we need to know about the Passes  tab, and the next tab is called Linking . Unfortunately, 
as mentioned in the previous chapter, it is still out of our grasp. However, don’t worry, as most of 
the time, you can leave it with the default settings; therefore, we can consider our first roughing 
operation completed!
Simulation
We already  discovered how to check the tool simulation in Chapter 4 ; therefore, we will skip all the 
options and jump straight to the results if we want to check the machined geometry with a simulation. 
We should find the following result:Discovering More Turning Strategies 126
Figure 5.8: Machined geometry result
There are a couple of things to highlight from the screenshot:
• As expected, the groove was not picked for machining since we suppressed the feature
• We machined a bit beyond the back of the part, as discussed on the Geometry  panel
• The stock is blue, meaning that there is extra material to remove for the next finishing operation 
(we left a layer of 0.2 mm all around)
For now, everything is working just as expected. In the following section, we will add the finishing 
pass and will remove the additional stock left around our geometry.
Turning Profile (Finishing)
After we have implemented the first roughing operation, it is a good idea to set a final finishing pass 
to remove only a tiny bit of material and achieve a good surface quality.
Turning Profile (Finishing)
 127
Fusion 360 comes with a handy operation called Turning Profile Finishing , which we can find among 
all the other turning operations in Figure 5.2 :
This is a contouring operation that will generate a toolpath parallel to the part profile. Before launching 
the command, we should know which type of tool we plan to use and which cutting settings will allow 
us to have the target surface quality we want.
For this operation, we can still use the same tool and shank used in the previous operation. The 
insert ( CNMG160616 ) can be used both for roughing and for finishing, in fact. Once again, we  will 
let CoroPlus calculate the optimal cutting parameters for the insert and simply copy and paste them. 
Let’s now launch the command!
The Tool tab
As we should already know, inside  this tab, we can specify the tool to be used and its main 
cutting parameters:
Figure 5.9: The Finishing Tool tab
Discovering More Turning Strategies 128
Here, CoroPlus suggested a much lower Cutting Feed per Revolution  in contrast to the roughing 
operation; here we have 0.08 mm , while previously, we had 0.5 mm , almost 10 times smaller!
Cutting speed (sometimes referred to as Surface Speed ) is set at 462 m/min  while the Maximum 
Spindle Speed  is set to 4000 rpm  since it is the maximum value my lathe can spin.
The Geometry tab
Inside the Geometry  tab, we can specify the working area as well as decide to exclude selected faces 
from toolpath generation. This is the same concept found in the previous roughing operation; since 
it is very similar to what we already explained, we will review this panel more quickly:
Figure 5.10: The Finishing Geometry tab
Here, we have to set the boundaries for the finishing operation by setting the Front  plane ( 1) and the 
Back  plane ( 2). Since we need to remove the extra stock left during the previous roughing operation, 
we need to machine the entire part length; therefore, we have to set the cutting boundaries to Model 
front  and Model back .
Once again, we still have to remove the groove from the machined geometry with the Groove Suppression  
feature ( 3). We will machine the circlip groove with a dedicated operation later in this chapter.
The Passes tab
Inside this tab, we can  find all the parameters to affect cutting passes:
Turning Profile (Finishing)
 129
Figure 5.11: The Finishing Passes tab
These are the most notable options we have to mention:
• Number of Stepovers : Here, we can specify how many cutting passes we want to perform. In 
our example, we simply need to remove a material layer of 0.2 mm; therefore, we can remove 
it with a single pass.
• Stepover : With this value, we can set the maximum cutting depth for our tool. At the moment, 
there is a default value of 2.4 mm . In reality, the tool will never cut at that depth since only 0.2 
mm has to be removed.
• Spring Pass : With this ticked, we can decide to perform a second pass identical to the first one. 
This is typical of finishing passes; it is used to remove the material that the first pass couldn’t 
remove due to part bending. However, most of the time, you won’t need it if you set the cutting 
parameters correctly.
• No Dragging : The goal of this option is again to improve the final part tolerances and finish 
by applying less negative pressure on the tool. Ticking this option will prevent the tool from 
cutting while pulling. Note that this option may increase machining time significantly.

Simulation
It is now time to check the simulation to find out whether the resulting operation is working:
Figure 5.12: Simulation results
The picture looks almost identical to the previous results with the roughing passes. However, there is 
only one notable exception: the stock is now green, meaning that there is no extra  material left on the 
part (it would be blue if there were) and that it was not over-machined (it would be red if it had been).
Now that we have introduced the main finishing strategy for turning, we can start with something 
a bit spicier; let’s try threading, but be careful — threading is one of the most difficult operations.
Turning Threads
In this section, we are about to discover how to machine threads with our lathe, but before jumping 
directly into the turning command that allows us to machine threads, we need to recap thread theory 
and check our thread specifications.
Turning Threads
 131
As you may recall, our example part features a thread starting from the front face. The first thing we 
will do is check the thread specifications. The thread we have to machine is an M42x4.5, a standard 
ISO thread with a coarse pitch.
All ISO screw threads are ruled by the following diagram:
Figure 5.13: ISO thread
Now that we can check the thread drawing, we can explain the parameters we can spot inside the diagram:
• P: This is the thread pitch. For a coarse M42, the pitch is 4.5 mm.
• Dmax : This is the screw’s maximum outer diameter. For an M42, this value must be between 
41.937 mm and 41.437 mm.
• H: This is the thread height measured between sharp corners:
In our example, 𝐻𝐻  is 3.897 mm.
• Dp: This is the pitch diameter, and it is equal to the following formula:
𝐻𝐻=√3
2∗𝑃𝑃 
𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃=D𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−3√3
8∗𝑃𝑃 Discovering More Turning Strategies 132
In our example, 𝐷𝐷𝑃𝑃  is 39.014 mm.
• Dmin : This is the internal diameter for our thread. It can be calculated with the following formula:
For our thread, this value is 37.066 mm.
Let’s keep these values in mind since we will need them later for the threading setup. The next step is 
to determine the cutting parameters for the operation we are about to create; once again we will use 
CoroPlus and use the suggested parameters:
Figure 5.14: Cutting parameters
As we can see, the suggested insert is 266RG-22MM01A450M . We will skip the part about how to 
create this tool since we should already be experts on this subject; instead, let’s analyze the suggested 
cutting parameters, and we can find something interesting.
First of all, as expected, we can see a Feed per revolution  value of 4.5 mm /rev, a suggested Cutting speed  
of 160 m/min , and 13 machining passes. Up until now, we’ve never had to set so many cutting passes!
Such a slow cutting speed and so many passes should suggest to us that threading can be quite a power-
hungry task. In the following pages, we are about to discover why threading is such a complex operation.𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚=D𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−5√3
8∗𝑃𝑃 
Turning Threads
 133
Now that we have all the numbers we need to machine and measure our thread, we can finally launch 
the Turning Thread  command that can be found in the drop-down menu shown in Figure 5.2 . As 
always, you will find yourself in the To ol  tab.
The Tool tab
Inside the To ol  tab, alongside the tool we plan to use, we also have to specify the type of threading 
we want to machine and the spindle rotation speed. We have already covered the tool we are about 
to use; therefore, let’s focus on the other settings:
Figure 5.15: The Threading Tool tab
As you can see from the screenshot, this tab is quite similar to the To ol  tab for the other operations 
we have already set up; there are just a couple of differences and hidden troubles I’ d like to highlight.
With Turning Mode , we can set whether we are performing Outside threading  or Inside threading . 
To keep things simple, let’s just say that Outside threading  will machine something like a screw, while 
Inside threading  will result in something like a nut. Our part looks like a screw, so we can leave the 
default value, Outside threading .
Discovering More Turning Strategies 134
The only other value we need to set is the Spindle Speed , which is expressed as rotations (or revolutions) 
per minute . CoroPlus gave us a cutting speed expressed in meters per minute  (m/min ), so we need 
to convert it to rpm. Let’s see  how to do this. As you may recall from the first chapter, cutting speed 
can be calculated using the following formula:
Where 𝑛𝑛  is the rotation speed expressed in rpm, 𝐷𝐷  is the diameter expressed in mm, and   is the 
cutting speed expressed in m/min. Using that formula, we can find the value of 𝑛𝑛 , which is equal to 
the following:
Once again, the equations have proved handy in solving a simple unit conversion issue! Now that 
we have calculated the exact rpm value, we can set Spindle Speed  accordingly inside the To ol  panel.
The Geometry tab
Inside this tab, we can set the starting position and the length of the thread:
Figure 5.16: The Threading Geometry tab
With Thread Faces , we can select the cylindrical surfaces where we want to machine our thread. There 
is a useful option called Confinement  that we should enable, allowing us to specify the machining 
boundaries for this operation.
With Frontside Stock Offset , we can specify an additional length on the front of our part to be 
threaded; this is always a good idea, as the tool will start threading a bit before the part begins, and 
this ensures that the entire length is machined properly.
With Backside Stock Offset , we can specify an additional length after the thread face has ended.𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐=𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋
1000 
𝑛𝑛=𝑉𝑉𝑐𝑐∗1000
𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋=1212  𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  
Turning Threads
 135
If we enable the Apply Back From Front  option, we can change the way Backside Stock Offset  is 
calculated: instead of being calculated from the back of the part, it is measured from the front  plane. 
It may sound more complex than it is, so take a look at Figure 5.17  for extra clarity:
Figure 5.17: Apply Back From Front
As you can see from the picture, with Apply Back From Front  enabled, we can only machine a portion 
of the thread face, while with the option disabled, the back offset is set from the end of the thread face.
In our example, the  thread is 25 mm long, and I want a safety margin of 5 mm on the front of our 
thread, so I set the values accordingly.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 136
The Radii tab
Inside the Radii  tab, we can specify the distance our tool has to retract between cutting passes; most 
of the time, just a couple of millimeters is sufficient:
Figure 5.18: The Threading Radii tab
In the example, I set the From  option to Selection , selecting the threaded face of the part. This way, 
the clearance will be calculated from the outer diameter of the thread. For Offset , we can add 2 mm 
as a safety margin.
The Passes tab
This tab is fundamental  because it is where we have to input the values we calculated using the formula; 
even a small error here will lead to a bad result:
Figure 5.19: The Threading Passes tab
Turning Threads
 137
There are several options we must specify with extreme precision:
• Threading Hand : This option affects the way we tighten or loosen our thread; The Right handed  
threads get tightened with a clockwise rotation, while the Left handed  threads get tightened 
with a counterclockwise rotation
• Thread Depth : This value is about how far the tool will enter into the stock during the final 
machining pass and it can be calculated with the following formula:
So, for our example, the formula is as follows:
• Number of Stepdowns : With this value, we can specify how many passes to perform during 
the threading operation. CoroPlus suggested we perform 13 passes, so we simply input the 
same value in the box.
• Thread Pitch : As previously mentioned, this value derives from the thread specifications; in 
our example, we are machining an M42x4.5; therefore the pitch is 4.5 mm .
• Do Multiple Threads : This option allows us to perform multiple threads. There are certain 
types of screws with multiple start threads, which are typically used for linear motion control. 
In this example, we are performing a standard bolt thread, so we  shouldn’t tick this box.
Note
Y ou can discover  more about multi-start threads in this article: https://blog.igus.
co.uk/difference-between-single-and-multi-start-threads/ .
• Infeed Mode:  This setting manages the working load on our cutting edge, adjusting the depth 
of cut accordingly. There are three different options, as listed here:
Figure 5.20: Infeed Mode optionsD𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−D𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
2 
41.937−37.066
2=2.4355𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 
Discovering More Turning Strategies 138
 Constant infeed : This is the most traditional mode where every cutting pass is performed 
at the same cutting depth. However, this is the worst mode because, with constant cutting 
depth, the working load on the cutting edge increases quite a lot from one pass to the next.
 Reduced infeed : With this option, we reduce the cutting depth at every pass to have a 
constant cutting-edge load.
 Alternate flanking : This is the most advanced strategy. Not only does it decrease the cutting 
depth at every pass, but it will also machine one side of the thread and then the other.
Y ou can be confident in both Reduced infeed  and Alternate flanking , but you should always 
avoid Constant infeed .
• Fade Thread End : With this option, we can stop the threaded area smoothly without a sudden 
interruption. Y ou should always pick this option if performing a limited-length thread, such 
as our example here.
• Spring Pass : This is similar to what we found before when reviewing the Turning Profile 
(Finishing)  strategy; it is a second pass that aims to compensate for any excess material due to 
part bending. In this case, the stock is quite thick and short; therefore, we don’t have to worry 
about bending.
• Use cycle : This is an advanced option that can work in tandem with the Post processor to reduce 
the amount of G-code generated (unfortunately, it is way beyond the scope of this book, so we 
won’t explore this topic).
Simulation
Now that we have set all the important parameters for our thread, we can run a simulation to check 
the result:Turning Threads
 139
Figure 5.21: Machined thread simulation results
The thread looks fine, but you may have noticed that the machined faces are red, which typically 
means that too much material was removed. Normally this would be an error but not in this case. 
Every time we create a threaded part, we never model the thread itself (it would be too difficult and 
time-consuming); we simply apply a cosmetic thread on the cylinder using a texture. So, with this 
warning, Fusion 360 is simply telling us that we went inside the modeled cylinder; therefore, we can 
safely ignore this warning.
I think it is now time to move to the next operation, turning drilling!
Discovering More Turning Strategies 140
Drilling
We haven’t mentioned this yet, but a  lathe is also capable of drilling. When drilling with a lathe, the 
drill bit doesn’t spin; it simply moves against the stock, and it is the part that is spinning.
There is one limitation, though: since we use the chuck rotation to remove material, the hole axis must 
be coincident with the rotation axis. There is no workaround to this limitation; it is the way drilling 
works with a typical lathe. If our part features multiple holes, we may need to use a milling operation 
after processing the stock on our lathe.
Another option would be a multi-spindle machine that can perform both milling and turning operations.
In the following pages, we are about to find out how to set up a simple drilling operation. Please note 
that there is not a dedicated drilling command for turning; the same command can be used when 
setting up both turning and milling operations. This is the reason why we will encounter few options 
inside the command that are not applicable to a lathe.
Let’s get back to our example part. It features a 16 mm diameter hole on the front face, and in the 
following pages, we will try to create this hole.
Note
If we had to create an internal thread on our part, we could reuse the Turning Threads  command 
and create an internal operation. However, if our thread hole is too small, we may even decide 
to perform a drilling and taping operation with a standard bit.
First of all, locate the Drilling  command, as shown in the following screenshot:
Figure 5.22: The Drilling command location
As usual, the command is divided into multiple tabs that we are about to analyze one by one.
The Tool tab
The To ol  tab is quite similar to  what we have already encountered several times:
Drilling
 141
Figure 5.23: The Drilling Tool tab
As you can see, we can specify the drill bit to use and the cutting parameters. Luckily, Fusion 360 
comes with lots of drill bits; therefore, most of the time, we should be able to find the diameter we 
need inside the built-in tool library. In our example, we will pick a drill bit that is 16 mm wide.
This time we don’t really need to use CoroPlus since there is a very handy Preset  drop-down menu 
that allows us to specify the cutting parameters according to the stock material; in this case, we will 
use the default preset, Low Carbon Steel - Drilling .
The Geometry tab
Inside this tab, we can specify where we  want to drill the holes. Please note that in turning, as already 
mentioned, we can drill along the rotation axis only; therefore, all the options managing multiple holes 
can be ignored; we will introduce them, anyhow, just for a better understanding of the command:
Discovering More Turning Strategies 142
Figure 5.24: The Drilling Geometry tab
Selection Mode  allows us to specify different ways to pick holes to be machined inside the part. When 
setting up a turning operation, we can drill a single hole along the rotation axis; therefore, we shall 
use the option called Selected faces , which allows us to pick the faces to be drilled.
However, with a milled part, we may have hundreds of holes to drill; therefore, instead of selecting 
them all one by one, we can tick the option called Select Same Diameter . With this option ticked, 
our operation will automatically drill every hole with the same diameter as the first one selected.
Then the next options, Order by Depth , Order , and Reverse Order , allow us to sort our drilling operations.
The following tab is called Heights , but we won’t review it since it is very similar to the Radii  tab that 
we have already seen multiple times. It is used to set the main working positions for our operation, 
such  as the clearance height and so on.
Note
Why is it called Heights  instead of Radii ? The answer is quite simple: drilling is not considered a 
turning operation inside Fusion 360; therefore, it shows an interface closer to a milling operation.
The Cycle tab
This tab is quite important, as  we can differentiate between drilling operations:
Drilling
 143
Figure 5.25: The Drilling Cycle tab
Though it’s small, you can see there are several options to choose from to select the type of operation 
we intend to set up. For our example part, we just need a simple Drilling – rapid out  operation, which 
is the default setting for standard blind holes. But from this panel, we can select other settings, such 
as the Tapping  and Counterboring – dwell and rapid out operations.
Note
Tapping is  an operation that machines a thread inside a hole with a special tool called tap for 
threading. Counterboring  is an advanced drilling operation that machines the housing for the 
head of a screw.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 144
Unfortunately, we won’t dive deeper into these operations because this chapter is centered on turning 
and because doing this would require a dedicated chapter; however, feel free to do your own research 
if you’re interested in learning more.
After this fast introduction to drilling with a lathe, we can move to the next cutting strategy we need 
to complete the example part: Turning Groove .
Turning Groove
In our part, there is a circlip groove  that we still have to machine. As we can spot in Figure 5.2 , there 
are two different types of grooving strategies we can use: Turning Single Groove  and Turning Groove .
What is the difference between the two? With Turning Single Groove , we can specify an edge where 
we want to perform a groove. And that’s it; almost no other option is available. On the other hand, 
Turning Groove  is a much more powerful command; not only can it be used for groove cutting, but 
it can also be used as a roughing strategy instead of typical longitudinal machining.
Before starting the command, we already know the tool we have to use and its cutting parameters. The 
tool we are about to use is coded as: N123T3-0150-0000-GS-1125 , which is a specific tool for grooving. 
For additional information on this tool, you can find the datasheet at the following link: https://www.
sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/products/pages/productdetails.aspx?c=n123t3-
0150-0000-gs%201125 .
As always, we can leave it to CoroPlus to produce all the equations. For the example, CoroPlus is 
suggesting a cutting speed of 242 m/min, a cutting feed of 0.05 mm/rev, and a chuck rotation of 
1,640 rpm.
Unfortunately, Fusion 360 has limited support for grooving tools; therefore sometimes, when creating 
a new tool from scratch, we can only set the most important dimensions, meaning that it will not look 
like the real tool, but it will still work just as well. In the following screenshot, we can find a simple 
tool that will pretend to be the real one:Turning Groove
 145
Figure 5.26: The grooving tool
As you can see, it is quite  a crude tool model, but it will work perfectly well for CAM purposes. For 
our scenario, we only have to look at the following three parameters:
• Groove width : This is the minimum width this tool is able to cut. In our example, the groove 
has a width of 2.15 mm. Therefore, we can use any tool with a smaller Groove width .
• Corner radius : This is the radius machined at the bottom of the groove. In our example, there 
is a sharp edge; therefore, a radius of 0 mm  is mandatory.
• Head length : This is  the maximum groove depth the tool can machine.
Now that we have the right tool in our library, we can finally launch the Turning Groove  command 
and start setting up the operation.
The Tool tab
As usual, the first tab we need to  look at is a rather typical To ol  tab that we should be already familiar with:
Discovering More Turning Strategies 146
Figure 5.27: The Grooving Tool tab
With Turning Mode , we can specify whether we want to perform Outside grooving or Inside grooving .
The next option is called Direction , and it is used to specify the cutting direction of the tool; we have 
three options to choose from:
Figure 5.28: Cutting Direction drop-down menu
Turning Groove
 147
This is the same key idea as we found in the second point of Figure 5.7 :
• Front to back : Here, the tool will start cutting from the front of our stock, one cutting pass 
after the other, until it reaches the rear of our part
• Back to front : Here, the tool starts from the rear of the part and moves toward the front of 
the stock
• Both ways : With this  option, the tool can cut back and forth
In order to choose correctly, we always have to consider our tool geometry and how the cutting edge 
is oriented. For our example tool, it doesn’t really matter because it has two cutting edges, but we have 
chosen Front to back (even if it could cut both ways, I would still choose this option).
The Geometry tab
As the name suggests, inside  this panel, we have to specify geometry-related parameters and the 
working area:
Figure 5.29: The Grooving Geometry tab
We can limit the working area of our groove by simply using Front Reference  and Back Reference . 
By selecting the two flanks of our groove this way, the tool won’t cut anywhere else but inside the 
groove itself.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 148
Once again, we find the Groove Suppression  option already encountered in Figure 5.6  and Figure 5.10 . 
Of course, at the moment, we don’t need to suppress this feature since we are trying to machine it, so 
we can leave Groove Suppression  unchecked.
Another option already seen but worth mentioning is Rest Machining . With this option selected, 
Fusion 360 won’t try to remove stock material where it has already been removed with previous 
operations. This is something we shall apply since, with previous operations, we already removed 2.5 
mm of stock above the groove during the roughing passes.
The Passes tab
As usual, the Passes  tab has  several options that we need to properly understand to master the command:
Figure 5.30: The Grooving Passes tab
Turning Groove
 149
As we can see, there are some elements already found in other turning operations, for example:
• Roughing Passes : This allows us to set multiple passes before a final pass. In our example, we 
will use a single pass; therefore, we shall leave this unchecked.
• Stock to Leave : We can use this option if we plan to implement an additional finishing pass 
over the machined geometry. For our example, we won’t enable this since we will machine the 
groove in only one pass.
• Use Reduced Feedrate : This can be useful if our groove is very deep. Let’s dig more into 
this option:
Figure 5.31: Groove depth comparison
As you can see in the diagram, the first groove is not very deep; therefore, it doesn’t compromise 
the stock strength; the part is not likely to bend there even with a high radial cutting load. On 
the other hand, the second groove is very deep, so the part may start vibrating and get damaged. 
A smaller feed will help generate a lower radial load when cutting close to the rotation axis. This 
same concept will be found when cutting our part from the chuck in the Turning Part  section.
• Up/Down Direction : This is an option that allows us to specify the cutting direction. We can 
force our tool to cut both when plunging inside the part and when retracting ( Up and down ), 
to cut only when plunging ( Down only ), or only when retracting ( Up only ). Changing the 
cutting direction may help us to reduce the radial load on the stock.
• Pass Overlap : This is an option that forces our tool to partially overlap the previously machined 
area to be sure that all the material has been removed. It is similar to the Spring Pass  option 
we have already encountered.
• Stepover : With this, we can set the maximum plunge depth for a single grooving pass. While 
with Number of Stepovers , we can set how many passes we want to perform. Again, this is 
very similar to the longitudinal roughing passes we have already covered.
After looking at the Passes  tab, as  usual, we will leave the Linking  tab behind. Now our first grooving 
operation should be complete, it is now time to review the result with a simulation.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 150
Simulation
Finally, our part is almost completed. I know that watching all the cutting operations being simulated 
can be somehow hypnotizing; however, we should only focus on the resulting geometry:
Figure 5.32: The Turning Groove resulting operation
We should have something similar to what is shown in Figure 5.32 . Please note that the color inside 
the groove is green, meaning that the result is correct.
It is now time to move to the last turning command, which is very similar to grooving: Turning Part  
(also referred to as Part Cutting  or Parting ).
Turning Part
Turning Part  is a command that allows us to detach our part from the stock cutting it. As you may 
imagine, cutting a part from the stock is typically the final operation to perform when turning a part. 
This type of operation is somewhat similar to grooving, with two major differences:
• When cutting, the cut width is not driven by the geometry of the part. We can cut whatever 
width we prefer. Of course, a higher cutting width means more material wasted and higher 
cutting power needed. Whereas, on the other hand, a super slim and super sharp cutting tool 
will cost more money and will wear in a shorter amount of time. Therefore, we should always 
aim at a trade-off between the material and the tool cost.
• When parting, our tool needs to plunge inside the stock, up until the rotation axis; therefore, 
cutting tools are usually longer and slimmer.
Turning Part
 151
For the following example, we will need these two links:
• This is the link for the shank: https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/
products/pages/productdetails.aspx?c=QD-NF-0250-0003-CR%20%201125
• This link is for the insert: https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/it-it/products/
pages/productdetails.aspx?c=qd-nn2f33-25a
In the previous links, we can find all the details needed to create our tool from scratch. Unfortunately, 
once again, Fusion 360 support for cutting tools is limited; therefore, we have to create a fake new 
cutting tool with a similar shape. Something like this should be fine:
Figure 5.33: Custom cutting tool values
We cannot create a super fancy tool with a complex geometry, but as long as we specify the Groove 
width  and the Head length , we can get a working result.
It is now time to launch Turning Part  from the list of turning operations in Figure 5.2 . As you may 
have noticed, the command is at the bottom of the list because, most of the time, it is the last command 
to set before the part is completed.
The Tool tab
Inside this panel, we can specify  the tool we want to use and the main cutting parameters. For this 
cutting, we will use a cutting speed of 173 m/min , a cutting feed of 0.14 mm  per revolution, and the 
maximum rotation speed supported by our chuck, which for my lathe is 4000 rpm :
Discovering More Turning Strategies 152
Figure 5.34: The Cutting Tool tab
Something to highlight here is an option called Use Part Catcher ; as you can imagine, once the part is 
cut from the stock, it will fall to the ground. Some advanced lathes have a device called a part catcher  
that takes the machined part and puts it in a defined position. With this option, we can enable the use 
of such a mechanism (if both our lathe and our Post processor support it).
Another detail I want to highlight is Maximum Spindle Speed ; as we already discovered in Chapter 1 , 
when cutting close to the rotation axis, the cutting speed drops to almost zero. That’s why, most of the 
time, when cutting a part, we have to set the maximum chuck rotation speed, in this case 4000 rpm .
There is not much to say about the Surface Speed  (set at 173 m/min ) and the Cutting Feed  (set at 
0.14 mm ), as both these values were calculated by CoroPlus, and simply copy and pasted.
The Geometry tab
Inside this panel, we can specify the position where we want to perform the part cutting, and whether 
we want a sharp edge, a chamfer, or a fillet on the edges:
Turning Part
 153
Figure 5.35: The Cutting Geometry tab
Here, we can specify the plane where we want to perform our cut; most of the time, the default setting, 
Model back , is fine.
A much more interesting option is called Edge Break ; with this option enabled, we can decide to create 
a chamfer or a fillet at the back of our part. This is something we definitely need for our example since 
there is still a chamfer we haven’t dealt with yet:
Figure 5.36: Back chamfer to be machined
Discovering More Turning Strategies 154
As you can see from Figure 5.36 , Edge Break  created a 45° cutting path to machine the chamfer on 
the back of our part, and we will see the results in just a moment.
The Radii tab
Inside this tab, we can specify the working positions for our operation. It is very similar to what we 
have already found several times previously:
Figure 5.37: The Cutting Radii tab
There is not much to say about this tab, but I’ d like to mention one important thing: for Edge Break  
to work properly, we need to set the Outer Radius  option to Model OD .
As you may remember, Outer Radius  is an option that allows us to trick Fusion 360 into thinking that 
the stock is a little bigger than the real one. We discovered that this could be used as a safety margin 
if we are not really sure about the stock diameter.
Setting a bigger diameter or an Offset  value will force Fusion 360 to machine the chamfer starting 
from the wrong position; therefore, the chamfer won’t be machined correctly. That’s why  we need to 
set the Outer Radius  value to Model OD .
However, our part has already been the subject of several machining passes; therefore, we should not 
expect the diameter to be bigger!
The Passes tab
The Passes  tab should look quite familiar to us, and indeed, it is quite similar to other operations we 
have already discovered:
Turning Part
 155
Figure 5.38: The Cutting Passes tab
There are a bunch of interesting options to analyze in this tab:
• Transfer Stock : If our lathe has two chucks, we can grab the part so it won’t fall once the cut is 
completed. An additional chuck can be used for further machining or as a part catcher.
• Use Reduced Feed and Speed : As previously mentioned when discussing grooving, with this 
option, we can reduce the cutting load once the stock diameter left to cut is quite slim.
• Reduced Parting Feed and Speed Radius : This is the diameter, after which cutting speed and 
feed will be reduced to the new value.
• Reduced Feed : This is the feed value that will be assumed once the tool is cutting below the 
specified radius.
Discovering More Turning Strategies 156
Simulation
We have completed our final operation, and our part should now be completed. Therefore, it is now 
time to check the simulation results to see whether everything was set up as we wanted:
Figure 5.39: Turning Part simulation results
I think we should be more than happy with the result; as you can see, the part is detached from the 
stock and the chamfer on the rear was correctly machined. What a great piece of machining!
Summary
Congratulations! Y ou completed the section related to turning. As you may already know, we didn’t 
really cover every single command or option available, but we can definitely say that you now know 
a major part of the CAM module.
As a quick recap, first, we learned how to set up roughing passes to shape our geometry with longitudinal 
operations. Next, we discovered how to set finishing passes with a contouring strategy.
After that, we discovered how to create a thread and how to drill a hole inside the part. And finally, 
we reviewed how to create a groove and how to cut the part. With all these operations in mind, we 
should be ready to set toolpaths for almost every shape machinable with our lathe.
It is now time to move forward from turning and start talking about milling. As we will discover, most 
of the key concepts will be almost identical, so we can say that the effort spent up until now will earn 
you a lot of additional knowledge!
Part 2 –  
Milling with  
Fusion 360
In this part, we will leave turning behind and move on to a more advanced machining  
technique – milling. Once again, we will build our knowledge of the topic starting from scratch; we 
will review all the most important milling strategies and their potential, to prepare ourselves to move 
on to creating a rather complex component.
In addition, to further improve our expertise on the topic, we will analyze the common mistakes 
encountered when dealing with milling geometries so that we know how to avoid them.

Getting Started with Milling 
and Its Tools
In this chapter, we will start moving from the turning world (which we should now be a bit familiar 
with) to the milling world, which has lots of potential and wide horizons for us to explore. Of course, 
this will lead us to new challenges and additional complexities that we will try to overcome during 
this chapter and the ones that follow.
We will discover the difference between a three-axis milling machine and a five-axis one, review the 
most common milling operations, and take a glimpse at the weirdly shaped tools that are involved 
in the cutting processes.
As always, we will learn useful formulas for parameter evaluation and a couple of golden rules that 
may save your day in the future.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Understanding what milling is and how it works
• Understanding the main cutting parameters
• Introducing the most common milling operations
Technical requirements
We won’t dig too much into milling theory and best practices since this book targets beginners, so 
there aren’t any mandatory requirements for this chapter. However, reading the chapters on turning 
theory, particularly Chapter 1 , will enhance your understanding of the subject since most of the 
formulas and concepts involved are very similar.Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 160
Understanding what milling is and how it works
Milling  is probably the most flexible and capable machining method, able to create the most complex 
geometries with good productivity at appealing (cheap and flexible) costs.
Contrary to turning, in milling, the spindle holds the cutting tool (and not the part) and it moves in 
multiple directions relative to the part being machined.
We will try to keep things plain and simple during this introduction, but there are so many things we 
must skip or oversimplify that purists may get a bit skeptical! Don’t worry, though – the core concept 
we are about to discuss is based on a solid ground founded on theory (just consider that you may find 
several exceptions in the real world that we don’t have time to discuss).
Let’s introduce milling processes by splitting machining into two main categories according to the 
number of degrees of movement of the spindle relative to the stock:
• Cartesian machines (up to three axes)
• Multi-axis machines (more than three axes)
Let’s explore these two families in more detail.
Note
Why do we always refer to movements relative to the part? The reason is very simple: there 
are so many different machine configurations. For example, we may have a gantry architecture 
with a spindle capable of moving along three directions (X, Y , and Z) and the stock standing 
still, or we may have a machine with a spindle that can only move along the vertical axis (Z) 
while the part is mounted on a working plate that moves along two axes (X and Y). These two 
architectures are very different, but if we think in terms of relative coordinates, they can be 
considered the same. For the sake of simplicity, from now on, we may omit the term “relative” 
if not strictly necessary.
Cartesian machines
Cartesian machines are by far the most common (and less expensive) option for a milling process. 
On this type of machine, the spindle moves (relative to the part) along the three axes of a cartesian 
coordinate system ( X, Y, and Z).
By providing a set of three coordinates to the machine (via CAM), the cutting tool can reach any 
point inside the working area. The following figure depicts a very simple milling operation by  
a three-axis machine:Understanding what milling is and how it works
 161
Figure 6.1: Cartesian machine
There are a couple of things worth noticing here. As you can see, the milling tool ( 1) is parallel to the 
z axis of the coordinate system ( 2), and it will maintain its orientation during the entire process. For 
a Cartesian machine, there is no way of tilting the tool in any direction in fact, so the geometry of 
machine ( 3) must be reached along the spindle axis only.
This is the main drawback of Cartesian milling machines – they lack a bit of flexibility when machining 
very complex shapes. Don’t worry about this for now, though; we will expand on these types of 
problems in Chapter 7  and Chapter 8 .
Multi-axis machines
Machines with more than three degrees of movement are defined as multi-axis machines. These are 
milling machines where the spindle is not just capable of moving along the three main axes (like  
a Cartesian machine), but they can also tilt the spindle along one or more axis. The most typical milling 
machines on the market feature four or five axes.
The following figure shows what a five-axis machine is capable of:
Figure 6.2: Five-axis machine
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 162
Not only is the tool capable of cutting the stock along the z axis (like a conventional Cartesian milling 
machine), but it can also rotate along the x axis and the y axis.
Thanks to modern electronic controls, this type of milling machine is gaining popularity at always 
cheaper prices. They also grant us high productivity and maximum flexibility when it comes to part 
geometry and complex shapes.
However, as a rule of thumb, we can say that multi-axis machines are still more expensive than three-
axis milling machines and a bit more difficult to program via CAM for beginners.
Multi-axis milling centers give us great potential and a wide horizon of possible machining options, 
but they are not based on magic – they still have their limits. If not even a multi-axis solution can 
machine a part, we most likely have to redesign the part or move to another manufacturing process 
(something such as additive manufacturing, for example).
In the following chapters, we will create machining operations for a three-axis machine, but don’t 
worry – these milling centers are still very powerful and capable (so capable that they sent a man to 
the moon!). Now, let’s look at the main cutting parameters when it comes to milling.
Understanding the main cutting parameters
Milling is a complex process that requires us to understand many different parameters and working 
operations. However, we shouldn’t be too scared of it since we should already be familiar with many 
turning operations.
In the following pages, we will discover how cutting parameters are conjugated for milling.
Spindle speed and cutting speed
Spindle speed and cutting speed are our old friends from turning operations; these concepts are the 
same for milling as well, so we will recap them a bit faster.
Spindle speed (  ) is how fast our spindle (and our tool) rotates and is measured in revolutions per 
minute  (RPM ).
Cutting speed (  ) is the tangent velocity on the cutting edge measured in meters per minute   
(m/min ) and can be calculated via the following formula:
Here,   is the outer diameter of the cutting tool measured in millimeters.=1000 Understanding the main cutting parameters
 163
The following figure shows a graphic visualization of the cutting and rotation speeds in the formula:
Figure 6.3: Cutting speed
Please note that, once again, the cutting speed is highly dependent on the radial position of the point 
of measure. Different points on the cutting edges have different cutting speeds. As a rule of thumb, we 
can decide to always use the outer diameter of the tool, but we should remember that there is a catch.
Cutting depths
As we should already know, the cutting depth is a parameter that measures how much the cutting 
tool is plunging inside the stock on a single cutting pass.
For a milling operation, there are two distinct parameters related to cutting depth:
• Axial depth of cut ( )
• Radial depth of cut ( )
Let’s find out the differences between these two values by looking at the following figure:
Figure 6.4: Cutting depths
As we can see, the tool is engaging the stock, milling a 90° profile on its corner. The height of the 
vertical face (parallel to the spindle rotation axis) is the axial depth of the cut ( ), while the width 
of the horizontal face (perpendicular to the rotation axis) is the radial depth of the cut ( ).
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 164
Both of these parameters are measured in millimeters and, as always, the higher the cutting depth, 
the higher the load on the tool.
It is important to note that we cannot set an arbitrary value to cutting depths. These two parameters 
are constrained by the geometry of the tool and the maximum cutting power available.
The following figure shows how to measure the maximum cutting depths on a tool:
Figure 6.5: Maximum cutting depths
Notice that the maximum axial cutting depth is the height of the cutting edge, while the maximum 
radial cutting depth is the outer diameter of the tool. It is not possible to exceed those values on a 
single cutting pass.
Now, let’s move on to the next parameter, which we should already be familiar with: the feed.
Feed step
The feed step  is a parameter that measures how much the tool advances at every revolution of the 
spindle. The only minor difference between a turning feed and a milling feed is related to the different 
types of cutting tools.
As you may have already noticed, turning tools have one cutting edge only, while milling tools have 
multiple cutting edges. This is an important difference since all the cutting formulas aim to calculate 
the ideal workload on a single cutting edge.
At constant tool load, increasing the number of cutting edges (or inserts) will reduce the load on each 
cutting edge, while decreasing the quantity will increase the load. Therefore, in milling, we typically 
work with three different feed values:
• Feed per tooth  ( )
• Feed per revolution  ( )
• Table feed  ( )
Understanding the main cutting parameters
 165
Let’s take a look at each of these now.
Feed per tooth
Feed per tooth (  ) is a parameter that measures the maximum thickness of the chip that every tooth 
is cutting, expressed in millimeters.
Note
In the mechanical world, the term tooth can be used to refer to gears and cutting tools. In these 
pages, tooth is intended to be a synonym for insert or cutting edge.
In the following figure, every tooth is highlighted with a different color and a number, and we can see 
rainbow strips where the tool is about to cut:
Figure 6.6: Feed per tooth
Every strip is the chip that is going to be generated by the corresponding teeth. The maximum thickness 
of the chip (along the cutting direction) is the value of the feed per tooth.
There are two main ways for a cutting edge to plunge into a part when machining, but the overall 
maximum chip thickness is not influenced by the approach of the cutting tool:
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 166
Figure 6.7: Up and down milling
As you can see, with climb milling  (also called down milling ), the cutting edge enters the stock 
where the chip is quite thick, while with conventional milling  (also called up milling ), the cutting 
edge enters the stock where the chip is thinnest.
Note
Climb milling is always preferred over conventional milling when possible. Peeling a very thin 
layer of chip from the stock is never the best way to go. The rule of thumb is to always enter 
the stock with a thick chip.
Feed per revolution
This parameter is equal to the turning feed that we use for turning operations. It is measured in 
millimeters per revolution  (mm/rev ) and expresses how much our tool moves along the cutting 
direction after a complete rotation of the spindle.
We can calculate the feed per revolution (  ) via the following equation:
=∗ Understanding the main cutting parameters
 167
Please note that   is the average number of teeth engaging the stock, not the total number of cutting 
teeth of the tool. Multiple things can change the number of engaged teeth; we are about to discover 
a couple of elements to consider.
The following figure provides a visual representation of the number of engaged teeth:
Figure 6.8: Engaged teeth
Here, the cutting tool is at an angle that engages two cutting edges in the stock. An instant later, since 
the tool is spinning, three teeth are engaged!
Another thing that changes the number of engaged teeth is geometry changes:
Figure 6.9: The engaged teeth change due to the geometry
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 168
As you can see, close to a corner, the number of engaged teeth can drastically change from the average 
number of engaged cutting teeth when machining a straight line – we pass from an average value of 
two teeth to four teeth engaged!
Changing the number of engaged cutting edges can modify the workload on the tool and lead to 
vibrations and resonances. That is why it is important to calculate the average number of engaged teeth.
However, thanks to modern CAM software, we can let the program create a toolpath with almost 
constant tool engagement.
If you want to explore a bit more about how a bad tool workload can ruin our parts, I strongly suggest 
you take a look at the following video by Haas Automation: https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=rKPxfzx3sxE .
Now that we have a general idea of what the milling feed is all about, we can move on to the next 
parameter, which is calculated using the values we just reviewed.
Table feed
Despite its name, the table feed ( ) is not a feed value but rather the speed of our tool when cutting 
the stock. It can be calculated by combining the other values with the following formula:
Or, as an equivalent alternative, we can use the following one:
Note
  is measured in millimeters per revolution, while   is expressed in revolutions per minute; 
therefore,   is expressed in millimeters per minute.
As you may imagine, it is really important to always be sure to mention units of measure when dealing 
with feed values with other people. Confusing these three feed values in the formulas will lead to 
unforeseen effects on the part or our milling machine.
Cutting power and torque
Now that we have reviewed the main parameters involved in milling theory, we can approach the 
most important formula to evaluate the required cutting power (  ):=∗∗ 
=∗ 
=∗∗∗
60∗106 Understanding the main cutting parameters
 169
Let’s recap the elements we can spot in the equation:
•   is the cutting power and is expressed in kilowatts  (kW).
•   is the axial cutting depth and is expressed in millimeters  (mm).
•   is the radial cutting depth and is measured in millimeters  (mm).
•   is the table feed value; it is expressed in millimeters per minute  (mm/min ) and it is obtained 
by multiplying spindle speed (  ) and feed per revolution (  ).
•   is a parameter related to the material we are cutting and is expressed in megapascal  (Mpa ), 
which you learned about in Chapter 1 . However, since   is highly dependent on the feed step, 
we can no longer retrieve the same value of   from the table we used for turning operations. 
The table we used in turning was expressed as a function of the feed step; however, as we just 
discovered, in milling, there are multiple types of feed values. To calculate   in milling, we 
have to work with feed per tooth. Luckily, we can find many charts and tables for a proper 
approximation of  , such as http://www.mitsubishicarbide.com/en/technical_
information/tec_rotating_tools/face_mills/tec_milling_formula/
tec_milling_power_formula .
The previous formula is very useful since not only does it let us calculate the cutting power required 
by a certain operation, but also if we flip it, we can use it to calculate one parameter if we already 
know the others.
For example, let’s suppose that we are wondering what the best axial depth of cut is for a certain 
operation. In that case, we would know the cutting power of our milling machine. At a given table feed, 
 , we know the feed per tooth, so by using a chart or a table, we can calculate the   value with ease. 
So, if we know all the other values in the formula, we can calculate the axial depth of the cut as well.
Now, moving on, to evaluate the torque, which is expressed by Newton meter  (Nm), we can use the 
following formula instead:
The formulas we’ve just discovered can be used both to calculate a cutting parameter we don’t yet know 
and to check if an operation we are planning to perform can be sustained by our machine. Depending 
on the maximum power and the torque of our spindle, we may need to reduce the workload if the 
required settings are too demanding.
Please note that our setup must verify both cutting power and torque requirements.=∗9549 Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 170
If all of those formulas sound a bit tricky to you, don’t be scared – multiple online calculators can do 
the math for you. CoroPlus is another great tool that can give us valuable suggestions on how to set 
all those parameters.
For now, let’s move on to the next section, where we will discover the main milling operations.
Introducing the most common milling operations
Milling flexibility translates to a wide range of different machining operations that can realize almost 
any shape conceivable.
We can divide milling operations into five main categories according to the tool used and the 
machined shape:
• Face milling
• Shoulder milling
• Slot milling
• Profile milling
• Other
Let’s introduce them one by one in the simplest way possible.
Face milling
Face milling is one of the most common and most simple milling operations. Its goal is to machine  
a flat surface perpendicular to the tool’s rotation axis. It can be considered both a roughing operation 
and a finishing operation according to the tool used and its cutting parameters. The following figure 
shows a typical facing operation:
Figure 6.10: Face milling
Introducing the most common milling operations
 171
As we can see, face milling tools can have complex geometries; they often have several replaceable 
inserts with the strangest shapes. These tools can be quite big and heavy and according to their 
dimensions, they can also be quite expensive.
A useful way to classify a facing tool is by using its entering angle:
Figure 6.11: Different entering angles
The most direct consequence of different entering angles is the direction along which the cutting force 
is exchanged between the cutting tool and the machined stock.
On the left of the preceding figure, there is a tool with a 15° entering angle; with such an entering 
angle, the cutting force is mainly transferred along the axial direction of the tool. Such a small entering 
angle reduces chip thickness and therefore allows a much higher feed step.
Facing operations with this type of tool have high productivity at low vibrations (since the radial 
force component is almost zero). Also, note that due to the insert’s small angle, the maximum cutting 
depth is quite shallow.
On the right of the preceding figure, there is a tool with a 90° entering angle. The cutting force of this 
type of tool is transmitted as a radial component only, so it is more prone to runout vibrations – they are 
not optimal from the point of view of chip formation either, so they lead to overall lower productivity.
However, operations with a 90° entering angle allow us to have a higher depth of cut and are useful 
for most mechanical components where there are many perpendicular surfaces. Also, a tool with 
such an entering angle can be used for other types of milling operations as well, so it is flexible and 
cost-saving (since a single-facing tool with a diameter of 100 mm may cost more than 500 euros).
In the center of the preceding figure, we can see a tool with the most common entering angle for 
facing operations. It is a tool with an entering angle of 45° and its characteristics are in a sort of sweet 
spot between the other two.
Now that we have discovered the very first milling operation, we can jump to the next one, which is 
in many ways similar to face milling.
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 172
Shoulder milling
Shoulder milling is quite similar to face milling, with the notable difference that the main machined 
surface is not perpendicular to the spindle axis but rather parallel to it. Once again, shoulder milling 
can be used as a roughing operation, as well as a finishing operation. There are multiple tools capable 
of performing shoulder milling, but for the sake of simplicity, we will stick to end mills only:
Figure 6.12: Shoulder milling
As we can see, sometimes, it can be difficult to understand if we are looking at a facing operation or a 
shouldering operation; there is not a clear and easy-to-understand distinction between face milling 
and shoulder milling.
For example, a face milling operation that employs a tool with an entering angle of 90° is performing 
a face milling operation on the bottom face of the cut and a shoulder milling operation on the sides 
at the same time.
Having already introduced a couple of milling operations, I’ d like to spend a few moments on two 
golden rules to always apply in milling (I promise that this extra effort will be worth it).
Choose the right milling diameter
One of the golden rules in milling (especially for roughing operations) is to always use the biggest 
tool possible. The bigger the diameter, the faster the operation and also the better the surface finish 
due to fewer vibrations at higher workloads.
As you can imagine, due to geometries or cutting power restrictions, sometimes, it is not possible 
to pick the biggest and toughest tool on the shelf. As a rule of thumb, to pick the right diameter for 
our operation, we should always select a tool whose diameter is at least 30% or 40% bigger than the 
cutting width (also called radial cutting depth) we intend to set.
Mind the centerline
Y ou should also remember to take care of the centerline placement. This may be a bit more complex to 
understand as it’s all about cutter diameter and radial depth of cut, but check out the following figure:
Introducing the most common milling operations
 173
Figure 6.13: Centerline placement
As you can see, on the left, we have a tool cutting at a very particular cutting position; the depth of 
the cut (  ) is equal to half the diameter of the cutting tool. This leads to having the centerline of the 
tool aligned with the point where the cutting edge enters the stock. It is a less-than-ideal condition 
since it causes high vibrations and faster insert wear.
In the center of the figure, we can find a much better situation where the radial cutting depth (  ) is 
around 75% of the tool diameter; this is an ideal position for a milling operation as it improves chip 
formation and reduces vibrations compared to the first example. There are very complex and painful 
formulas to demonstrate why this is a better approach than the previous case, you just have to trust 
me, unfortunately!
An even better scenario is shown on the right, where the radial cutting depth (  ) is around 25% of 
the tool diameter. This way, we are also respecting the first golden rule since the cutting diameter is 
way more than 30% bigger than the radial cutting depth!
Slot milling
Slot milling is a milling operation where the tool plunges inside the stock and machines the material 
into a shape, similar to the keyway of a shaft. Several slot milling techniques are using different tools 
but we will only analyze those machined with end mills since they are the most flexible.
The following figure shows a closed slot with quite a complex profile:
Figure 6.14: Slot milling
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 174
At first glance, we may think that we are not dealing with something tricky, but in reality, this type of 
operation can be really painful for our tool! As we can see, machining slots with an end mill allows us 
to machine almost any slot path (which is good news). However, creating a slot (especially if closed) 
with an endmill is a demanding task for the following reasons:
• If the slot is closed, our tool is forced to plunge into the stock axially, which is never a good 
way to approach the part
• Most of the cutting edges are constantly engaged
• For deep slots, chip evacuation is a problem we have to seriously consider
• Our tool is forced to operate in conventional milling, and as already mentioned, up milling is 
not the most ideal approach for a milling operation
• According to the slot shape, the number of engaged teeth may instantly change leading to 
strong vibrations
Wow, that was unexpected; there are so many complexities for such an apparently simple operation. 
Ignoring hidden troubles when approaching CAM may cause lots of painful frustration.
To simplify your experience with slot milling, I’ d like to give you one useful tip just in case you need 
to machine a proper shaft keyway with a tight tolerance one day. As shown in the following figure, 
the first shaft is machined with an endmill whose cutting diameter fits perfectly the slot. The cutting 
toolpath is moving the tool back and forth; this is never the best solution as it will cause a bad surface 
finish and the slot walls may not be perpendicular to the bottom of the slot due to the high workload:
Figure 6.15: Slot milling tip
A much better approach to proper slot milling is depicted in the second example, where the slot is 
milled with a smaller tool that moves around the slot contour. This option is better because most 
of the troubles that we learned are related to slot milling and will be present only during the first 
approach to the stock; after this, the tool will machine the rest of the material as a typical shoulder 
milling performed in a climb cutting operation.
Introducing the most common milling operations
 175
Profile milling
Profile milling is an advanced milling operation that involves machining a complex smooth surface 
along multiple directions. For this type of operation, a multi-axis machine shines, but even a standard 
Cartesian machine can express its potential if the geometry is not very complex.
Profiling is almost always used as a finishing operation; therefore, it is important to always prepare 
the surface to machine with previous roughing operations.
As shown in the following figure, the idea behind this machining technique is to let the tool follow the 
surface to machine with very small incremental steps; the smaller the step, the better the finish quality:
Figure 6.16: Profile milling
On the right, we can find multiple sharp edges (similar to a set of stairs) left from previous roughing 
operations yet to be machined, while on the left, we can find the shiny surface already finished.
For this operation, it is critical to reduce the vibrations to the bare minimum, so a short tool and a 
solid fixture are mandatory. The most common group of tools used for profiling include round inserts 
and ball nose end mills.
Please note that there are multiple profiling techniques according to the shape to be machined. Every 
profiling technique will create different toolpaths; however, the final result will be more or less similar.
Other
As you may have guessed, Other  is not a type of milling operation, but rather it is a group of very 
specific operations that cannot be classified under the previous categories. There are so many additional 
milling processes we haven’t mentioned yet, from gear milling to turn milling; unfortunately, we don’t 
have time (nor space) to cover them all.
The only milling operation inside this group we will review is thread milling. It is a process where we 
can create a thread without using a tap or a die, much like we did when threading the example part 
on turning in Chapter 5 . Instead, thanks to modern CNC machines, it is now possible to machine a 
thread with a special tool by applying a helical movement:
Getting Started with Milling and Its Tools 176
Figure 6.17: Thread milling
As we can see, the tool is performing a downward spiral path while simultaneously controlling the 
tool rotation, resulting in a threaded hole. There are several advantages to this technique instead of 
following a typical approach with a tap or a die:
• A single tool allows us to thread a wide range of threaded holes, while with a tap, we need one 
for each different thread dimension
• Chip evacuation is much easier since the tool is smaller than the hole
• It is possible to thread almost the entire length of a blind hole
We will try to implement all these operations using Fusion 360 in the examples provided in Chapter 9 , 
and Chapter 10 ; we just need a bit more knowledge before jumping right into the action!
Summary
With that, we have introduced milling operations. It was not as detailed as it could have been, but 
a more complete overview would have required a dedicated book on the subject. I hope that the 
information provided has encouraged you to explore this amazing technology further.
Now, let’s recap what we have learned. First, we understood how a milling tool can move relative to 
the stock, and the differences in degrees of movement between a traditional three-axis machine and 
a multi-axis machine.
Then, we plunged into the theory behind milling operations and looked at the main cutting parameters 
present in formulas for cutting power and cutting torque. After presenting those formulas, we learned 
how to use them to calculate a missing parameter when we know all of the others.
Moving on, we presented the main milling operations, and we provided a couple of useful suggestions 
on how to avoid hidden troubles when implementing our CAM operations.
Understanding all these concepts is the starting point for future chapters, where we will experiment 
with milling in a real-world scenario.
In the next chapter, we will discuss possible design flaws in milled parts and how to optimize the 
shape of our parts.

Optimizing the Shape of Milled 
Parts to Avoid Design Flaws
Sometimes, when working on a concept project, we can create our shape driven by its intended use 
or interactions with other mechanical components.
A usage-driven approach is perfect for achieving the most optimized geometry that will work the best. 
However, we may miss a few important details needed from a manufacturing point of view. These 
“minor details” , however, may be the key difference between a cheap component and a much more 
expensive one or even an impossible part to machine.
In this chapter, we will explain the most typical issues with milled parts, showing you a wide set of 
tricky geometries to be milled and the approach to achieving them successfully. This should give you 
the tools for a more aware and better approach to part design.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Handling undercuts and accessibility
• Learning how to manage mill radius
• Solving a very bad design
Technical requirements
The main technical requirement for this chapter is having a basic knowledge of part design using 
any CAD software. Making sure you have read Chapter 6  is a great starting point since we will now 
dive deeper into milling, but this time from a design perspective. We will also discover a couple of 
commands from Fusion 360 that can help us during the design process; therefore, having access to 
the program is also recommended.Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 178
Handling undercuts and accessibility
There is a typical issue with milled parts that can be found in models designed without a clear 
understanding of manufacturing limitations: geometry undercuts .
What is this issue all about? The important thing to understand is that our machine can reach any 
point located inside its working boundaries, but the geometry we are trying to machine may restrict 
accessibility and impede tool movement. Areas not accessible to our tool are called undercuts.
The following diagram is an example of a badly designed part featuring an undercut:
Figure 7.1: Undercut
As you can see from the diagram, the highlighted area is inaccessible to our tool; therefore, it cannot 
be machined.
Before starting any milling setup, we should always analyze in detail part geometry and check for 
undercuts. If the shape to be machined is quite complex, there is a useful tool inside Fusion 360 that can 
spot undercuts. This  command is called Accessibility Analysis  and can be found in the following menu:
Figure 7.2: Accessibility Analysis
Handling undercuts and accessibility
 179
This command is very  similar to Draft Analysis  you may have already used inside the DESIGN  
environment of Fusion 360 or any other CAD software.
Note
Draft analysis is a  geometrical analysis of the orientation of surface normals. This analysis 
is typically used for mold design to check whether an object can be removed from the mold 
once solidified.
Accessibility Analysis  is a simpler type of analysis, giving us information about positive or negative 
drafting angles:
Figure 7.3: Undercuts spotted
As you can see from the screenshot, we can select a Body  to analyze and a Direction  by simply clicking 
on a face or an edge. The surfaces highlighted in green are reachable by a tool along the specified 
direction, while red areas are to be considered undercuts.
Undercuts should always be avoided when designing a new part; however, sometimes, the component 
we need to machine must have an undercut geometry due to its mechanical function. If this is the 
case, we may need to try a few workarounds to machine undercuts successfully; however, don’t get 
too excited, as we can only successfully solve minor undercuts. If the part was not really designed 
with milling processes in mind, it might be necessary to drastically change its shape. Let’s examine  
a few typical solutions.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 180
Changing part orientation relative to the tool
Sometimes an area of our part may be unreachable for the tool if oriented along a certain direction, 
but it may become machinable if we change its orientation.
Figure 7.4: Undercut analysis profile
As we can see here, the accessibility analysis shows that most of the object can be machined along the 
z axis, while a few areas are not reachable. These undercuts are reachable along the x axis; therefore, 
we can set up two placements for machining. Multi placements are an advanced type of machining 
where the stock is moved or rotated between one cutting operation and the next.
For example, we can first decide to machine the slot along the x axis and then to machine everything 
else along the z axis:
Figure 7.5: The x axis direction
After fixing  the stock as shown, the slot can be machined without undercut-related issues. After this 
operation (the first placement) we can open our CNC machine, remove the partially machined stock 
from the vise that holds it in place, rotate the part, close the vise again, and machine all the other faces 
(this would be the second placement):
Handling undercuts and accessibility
 181
Figure 7.6: The z axis direction
Don’t  worry about the machined leftover radii that are left on the part because we will dive into 
them in the following Learning how to manage mill radius  section. Part orientation and the order of 
machining placements are difficult subjects to master; there is not one general solution that works 
in every scenario.
Also, sometimes the final scope of the component we are machining may force us to use a less-than-
optimal approach from a manufacturing point of view. It is always a good idea to keep a constructive 
dialogue open with parts designers to understand whether certain problematic features on the part 
are strictly needed or whether it is possible to tweak the shape a little to optimize production times 
and costs.
Using a multi-axis machine
Sometimes  even changing the part orientation is not enough to solve accessibility issues because 
the features to be machined smoothly  change their normal direction. For example, in the following 
diagram, there is a very complex slot profile to be machined on the cylindrical surface:
Figure 7.7: A complex profile
Working on this part with a basic three-axis milling  machine is a problem. In order to achieve the 
feature as shown, we would need to change part orientation an infinite amount of times.
In this type of scenario, such a part requires the use of a multi-axis machine capable of tilting the 
spindle (or the part) along multiple rotation axes. Please note that since five-axis machines have  
a much higher degree of complexity, we will stick to conventional machines with three axes only.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 182
Note
A normal vector to a surface is a vector which is perpendicular to the surface. By convention, 
the tip of a normal vector to a surface points outwards. For example, a normal vector to the 
face of a cube is oriented inside out. Curved surfaces have a normal vector constantly changing 
on every point of the surface.
Creating custom tools
Sometimes, part of the geometry we have to machine is inaccessible even when using a multi-axis 
machine. This is the worst-case scenario, but we may still have a last ace up our sleeve.
As a last resort, we may decide to build a custom tool shaped in such a way as to reach the inaccessible 
area. This is a technique that is very often used for wood machining; it is not a great method for harder 
materials such as steel, but it is still possible in principle:
Figure 7.8: A custom tool
As you can see, it is impossible to machine such a sharp undercut using a typical cylindrical flute; 
however, with a properly shaped mill, we can machine very complex geometries with ease. The key 
idea of this type of operation is that the tool shape is imprinted in the stock while machining; therefore, 
a complex tool profile will lead to a complex part shape.
Fusion 360 features a very simple way to create custom tools; let’s find out how with the following 
example part:
Figure 7.9: A complex profile
Handling undercuts and accessibility
 183
This part features quite a complex profile machined inside the stock; with so many sharp angles and 
low accessibility areas, there is no way we can machine this.
For this, we could build a custom tool that reflects the machined profile. In order to do this, we can 
create the profile for our tool with a simple 2D sketch inside the DESIGN  environment of Fusion 360:
Figure 7.10: A custom profile
As you can see, I created a closed sketch that copies the profile of the part. Please note that you shall 
draw the shank profile and the spindle axis as well.
Once the sketch is completed, we can open the MANUFACTURE  environment and launch the 
following command, Form Mill :
Figure 7.11: The Form Mill command
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 184
With Form Mill,  we can create a custom tool providing a sketch as input:
Figure 7.12: The Form Mill command
The interface is pretty straightforward but let’s review it in detail:
• To ol Profi le : With this selection box, we have to pick the closed sketch that we created earlier
• Tool axis : With this selection, we can specify the rotation axis of the spindle
• Compensation Point : This is the point that is going to be used to create toolpath coordinates; 
most likely, you want to set this point on the bottom of the tool or the corners of the profile
Once everything is set correctly, we should find the resulting tool inside the tool library, ready to be used!
Not only can this type of form tool be useful for solving undercuts issues, but it can also speed up the 
machining of complex profiles. A form tool can machine, with a single pass, what a cylindrical tool 
may machine in several operations.
Getting back to undercuts, if not even a custom mill is capable of machining our part, chances are 
that nothing else will. If this is the case, we should probably change the part shape or change the 
manufacturing technology and opt for something a little bit more flexible, such as additive manufacturing.
Backside milling
Backside milling is another advanced technique that can help us to reduce the total number of 
placements, solve undercuts issues, and improve tolerances.
Learning how to manage mill radius
 185
It can be a bit tricky to understand how backside milling works, so think of it like this: imagine a 
conventional drilling operation, where the drill bit enters the part pushing against the stock; with 
backside milling, our tool enters the part pulling against the stock!
For example, let’s suppose we have at our disposal a three-axis machine and that we want to machine 
both sides of the stock without setting multiple placements:
Figure 7.13: Pull milling
As you can see, on the right, we have the front face of our stock already machined successfully. 
However, we need to machine the back face as well (which is, of course, inaccessible from the front).
However, if there is sufficient room, with a special tool, we can move the tool through the hole ( 1), 
move it radially at a safe distance from the stock ( 2), and then start pulling the tool against the stock 
and machine the back face ( 3).
As you can imagine, this is a very tricky technique that can be implemented in only a few cases due to 
the limited access to the undercut area. However, it is worth mentioning since it may help us machine 
an otherwise inaccessible area!
I hope that exploring all these techniques to solve undercuts will help you in designing better parts and 
in solving accessibility issues. It is now time to move on to the next typical issue found on milled parts.
Learning how to manage mill radius
Having worked with milled parts for years, I can assure you that another common issue you will 
encounter is the wrong management of the mill radius.
To overcome this, you need to understand the following concept: milling processes cannot perform 
squared slots, and the mill radius will always be imprinted on the part.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 186
In the following diagram, we can better understand the problem:
Figure 7.14: Mill radius
As you can see from the diagram, there is no way for our flute to leave a rectangular-shaped slot. If 
the mill cutter has a 20 mm diameter, we will always leave a 10 mm radius on corners. But what if we 
really need a squared slot? There are a few techniques that can help overcome this intrinsic behavior 
of milling machines:
• Reducing the mill radius
• Tweaking our part geometry
• Changing the milling direction
Let’s look at these three options in more detail.
Reducing the mill radius
This is by far the simplest option we have, as it doesn’t involve any changes to the geometry. We simply 
need to change our milling operation with a smaller cutting tool.
We should be very careful when choosing this radius management strategy since a smaller tool always 
has several drawbacks when compared to a bigger one: it will cut much slower, it will wear faster, and 
it won’t be able to cut at high depths. Therefore, the final cost of the part will be higher!
Learning how to manage mill radius
 187
Having said that, in the following diagram, we can visualize what a smaller tool radius will lead to:
Figure 7.15: Mill radius reduction
Part 1 has been machined with a much smaller tool, and its angles feature a much smaller leftover 
radius than the ones on part 2. However, we have improved the shape, but we still don’t have the sharp 
angles shown in the designed part 3!
Therefore, a smaller tool can leave a small enough radius that won’t cause trouble for the components 
our part will be coupled with. And yet, sometimes, it still won’t fit if the coupled part has sharp edges. 
Let’s check out the following diagram for a better understanding:
Figure 7.16: Mounting problems
Let’s suppose we need to mount a part with chamfered edges inside the machined slot. The slot on the 
left has a leftover radius that is too big and will deny the coupling. In the center, we find a slot machined 
with a much smaller tool radius; it is smaller than the chamfered edge; therefore, we can couple the 
two parts together, which is great. However, on the right, we can see the worst-case scenario: the part 
we have to mount has sharp edges. In this case, no matter how small the tool is, the two won’t fit, and 
in this case, we must choose another radius management option.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 188
Tweaking our part geometry
The best option we have to allow a good coupling with a sharp part is a minor change to the geometry 
of our milled part. In the following diagram, we can view a typical example:
Figure 7.17: Shape tweak 1
As we can see, the  part being mounted has sharp corners; therefore, it won’t fit if there are any leftover 
radii on the corners of the slot. In the figure, however, it does fit because there are two bulges at the 
end of the slot. This way, we can have a perfect mechanical stop, and we can also machine the slot 
with a bigger tool!
This is the most flexible and advanced strategy, and it can be conjugated in a variety of different 
shapes. We just have to find the shape that best fits our scenario. For example, you may have noticed 
in Figure 7.17  that there is not much material left at the end of the slot to work as a mechanical stop. 
A much better option is the following arrangement of the bulges:
Figure 7.18: Shape Tweak 2
Learning how to manage mill radius
 189
As you can see, we  can still couple our part with a squared component, but we also have a much bigger 
area that works as a mechanical stop at the end of the slot!
There is one more thing that can manage the leftover radius on our part: changing the cutting orientation. 
Let’s discover together how tool orientation influences the radii.
Changing the cutting direction
We just  discovered that to manage the leftover radii of a milled part; we can reduce the tool diameter 
or tweak the geometry to create something close to a Mickey Mouse profile. However, as you can 
imagine, changing the spindle orientation will lead to a completely different radii pattern as well!
From the following diagram, we can now immediately spot a part that was designed without considering 
the tool radius ( 1):
Figure 7.19: Spindle orientation
After understanding the intended function of the milled slot, we can decide the direction of our cutting 
tool relative to the part. For example, we can decide to orient the tool along the x axis ( 2), along the 
y axis ( 3), or again along the z axis ( 4).
Please note that these orientations will not only cause different radii placements but may also lead to 
different machining times and different final costs.
The best option to pick for this example is to only machine our part along the z axis; this is due to 
the fact that we must already machine the hole along the z axis. As you may have guessed, with a 
five-axis machine, we can smoothly change spindle orientation, while with a three-axis machine, we 
can change the cutting direction by rotating the part onto the working area with different fixtures.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 190
Let’s now suppose that, for whatever reason, we must machine the slot on our example part along the 
y axis with a three-axis machine:
Figure 7.20: Machining a part with two placements
The first operation we can do is to fix our part so we can mill or drill the hole ( #1); this is the first 
placement. After this first operation is completed, we can open the machine, remove the part from 
the first fixture, and mount it rotated ( #2) onto a second fixture. Then, we close the machine and start 
a second machining task that will cut the slot.
This type of work can be done, but it takes more time, as well as requiring a trained operator who can 
mount the part correctly for the second placement without flipping it.
As you can imagine, it is quite more expensive than only machining everything along the z axis. 
Therefore, unless we have to use multiple placements, we should always avoid multiple spindle 
orientations as much as possible.
Note
Y ou should definitely check out a very interesting video by Haas Automation to better understand this 
subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFvBe7cqxOE&list=WL&index=45 .
Getting used to spindle orientation, stock placements, and design errors are key points for advanced 
milling usage. In the following section, we will be presented with a 3D model with several machining 
issues. We will try to critically analyze what is and isn’t feasible when machining the part.
Solving a very bad design
 191
Solving a very bad design
Now that we mentioned a few of the typical problems we may find with parts, we can review an example 
part to be machined from a squared stock. Let’s suppose that we are CAM operators and that a group 
of designers give us this part to realize:
Figure 7.21: Example part to machine
This part is most likely an April fool’s joke against us; there are a number of very big mistakes that not 
even a beginner can be excused for! But let’s imagine this is the real deal and that we have to somehow 
machine it with our milling machine.
Let’s review the mistakes one by one and try to find possible solutions with the design team.
Undercut face
There is a well-pronounced sloped face that cannot be machined at the moment. As we are about to 
discover, there are only three options available to us to achieve a similar shape, but all of them require 
minor changes to the design.
There is no correct one; picking one strategy over the other depends on the part usage and requirements.
Inclined tool
The first approach I would try to machine the undercut area requires a minor compromise to the 
design. I would propose machining the sloped face entering the stock with an inclined tool, which 
is very simple to achieve with a multi-axis milling machine (it may be a bit trickier on a three-axis 
machine, but still achievable):
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 192
Figure 7.22: Inclined tool
As you can see, the sloped face is machined properly with only two minor drawbacks:
• There is a little bit of extra material removed on the bottom of the sloped face
• There is a leftover radius on the blind side of the slot.
If this radius compromises the function of the part, we could also opt for the following tweak in 
the geometry:
Figure 7.23: Radius management option
Now, the geometry is machined properly, and any part that may be installed inside the slot will still 
fit since we removed more material than intended in the original design.
Solving a very bad design
 193
Deep milling
If we  don’t have a multi-axis machine at our disposal, and we don’t want to create a complex fixture 
to hold the part at weird angles, we could lay the stock down on one of the flat faces and machine it 
with a deep milling operation.
Figure 7.24: Deep milling
As you can see, entering the stock from the side will resolve the problem of the undercut and won’t 
create a radius at the end of the slot. It could be a viable solution if we already have other features to 
be machined with the same tool orientation; however, in the example given, there aren’t; therefore, it 
may not be the ideal solution.
In addition, we  still have a leftover radius on the bottom of the slot, and we may need a very long tool 
to be able to machine the entire length. Using long and slim tools (like the one shown in the picture) 
is never a good idea, as they will bend more when machining; therefore, much lower feed steps must 
be used, and the total machining time will be affected dramatically.
Most likely, if the previous solution was not okay, this won’t be either. This is definitely not the solution 
I would pick, but it is still worth mentioning.
Using a custom tool
The only other option, without a major redesign of the part, would be the usage of a custom tool. 
However, even with a custom tool, there will be leftover radii.
In the following example, with this type of tool, the bottom of the slot is flat, and the edges of the 
sloped face are sharp:
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 194
Figure 7.25: A custom tool
There are also a few drawbacks:
• On the end of the slot, there is a very pronounced leftover conical shape that was not featured 
at all in the designed part
• In addition, we should always keep in mind that custom tools are very expensive
For our example, I would say that, unless the sloped face features an angle of 60° or 45°, which is an 
angle we might already find in a tool catalog, I would not choose this type of machining.
Now that we have explored a few possible solutions to the sloped face – albeit solutions that won’t 
completely work – let’s choose one of them and move on to the next issue with the part.
Missing tool radii
A minor issue to fix is the lack of any consideration for tool radii; however, there is not much we can 
do on this topic. Due to accessibility issues, we can only choose to machine the part along the z axis 
or the y axis:
Solving a very bad design
 195
Figure 7.26: Machining direction
As you can see here, on the left, we have a leftover radius with a machining direction along the z axis, 
while on the right, it is set along the y axis. Choosing one or the other is dependent on the part’s needs. 
However, if the choice doesn’t compromise the part, we will opt for a milling process along the z axis.
The reason is quite simple: machining along y would require a much longer tool with all the drawbacks 
already discussed when evaluating deep milling.
We should now have clarified most of the milling process of the part, but there are two more issues 
to address.
Counterbore holes
The next major problem to fix is related to the counterbore holes on the sloped face we just machined. 
These holes are almost impossible to realize; the only option to have them as designed is to backmill 
them with an advanced tool, but it is something that is quite difficult, time consuming, and expensive 
to achieve.
Figure 7.27: Counterbore holes
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 196
Note
Y ou can take a look at reverse boring tools using the following link: https://www.hermann-
bilz.de/en/products/back-counterboring/ .
If we don’t want to pick reverse counterboring tools, we can try a different approach to the part. For 
example, we could decide to reach the counterbore by extending it through the entire stock, as shown 
in the following diagram:
Figure 7.28: Back drilling
As you can see, if backside milling is not possible or desirable, we could decide to machine the 
counterbore faces from the back of the stock. With a long tool, we can machine the geometry, but 
also introduce holes on the bottom of the slot, which may not be good, depending on the part’s usage.
For this example, I think the only realistic solution to the issue is investigating whether the counterbore 
faces really are needed and whether, with a minor design change, we can get rid of them because a 
much simpler option would be a simple hole all the way through.
As you can see, if the counterbore faces can be suppressed, we can access the part from the outside 
with the simplest drill bit, which would definitely be my choice if possible:
Summary
 197
Figure 7.29: Simple holes
Now that we have discussed the hardest part to fix for this example, there is one last minor issue that 
would be nice to resolve.
All around radii
As you may have noticed in the part presented in Figure 7.21 , all the exterior edges were smoothed 
out with a fillet.
Fillets are not impossible or difficult to machine; however, having them on every outer edge of the 
part would require us to machine all the fillets on one side, rotate the part for a second placement, 
and then machine all the fillets on the other side. Doing all these placements on a three-axis machine 
may be a little tricky; therefore, if all those fillets are not strictly needed, it would be preferable to 
remove those facing the bottom of the stock. This way, we can reduce the total number of placements, 
increasing productivity and reducing costs.
We just found a couple of tricks to approach complex geometries and a few workarounds to machine 
impossible shapes with minor compromises. I hope these suggestions help you in your everyday life 
as a CAM operator!
Summary
That was the end of the chapter, let’s recap what we learned together. We introduced the basic concept 
of undercuts inside the geometry of the part and how undercuts are strictly related to tool orientation. 
Then we analyzed a couple of examples centered on how to machine undercuts if their presence is 
required by the part’s intended use.
Optimizing the Shape of Milled Parts to Avoid Design Flaws 198
After this introduction to accessibility issues, we learned what leftover radii are and how to get rid 
of them if they compromise our part coupling with other components. Then we introduced the 
concept of multiple machining placements, and we found how they can change radii patterns and 
undercuts machining.
And finally, we tried to apply all the described techniques to a very tricky part to be machined.
This introduction to typical errors found on milled parts is essential for approaching the design  
of a part to be realized by milling operations.
In the following chapter, we will move on from the theory discussed till now, and we will start setting 
up milling operations with Fusion 360.8
Part Handling and  
Part Setup for Milling
The most critical step when approaching milling processes is the setup. During the setup, several 
important decisions can greatly influence machining complexity, time, and costs even before turning 
the CNC on. For this reason, before jumping into action, we should always look closely at the geometry 
we need to machine, searching for hints about the best possible milling workflow.
In this chapter, we will try to analyze a complex part, starting right from the 2D drawing. We will 
learn how to extract important pieces of information from drawing details and how to lay down  
a possible workflow with multiple placements using WCS offsets. After this analysis, we will learn 
how to create a multiple-setup CAM project with Fusion 360.
The goal of this book, and this chapter in particular, is to change your point of view and move you 
from a design perspective to a manufacturing perspective. We will work on a real-life scenario, where 
we will be presented with multiple challenges and possible solutions.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Understanding the part
• Choosing part placements
• Choosing a part fixture
• Choosing WCS offsets
• Defining the first setup
• Defining the second setup
Technical requirements
In order to follow along with this chapter, make sure that you have read Chapter 6  and Chapter 7 .Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 200
Understanding the part
The first thing we need to do before creating a proper CAM setup is focus on the shape of our part. We 
want to aim to have a complete understanding of the part’s geometries, tolerances, and surface finish. 
Not concentrating on analyzing the part may lead to different machining approaches; that’s why it is 
so important to take our time and check the drawings with the highest attention.
In the next few pages, we will explain how to machine the following part on a three-axis machine. 
The following figure shows a 2D drawing of the part we will be looking at:
Figure 8.1: Part 2D drawing
What data can we extrapolate from this drawing?
• The component’s overall dimensions are 110 x 110 x 42 mm.
• On the two planes defined by the 42 mm dimension, a good surface finish (3.2 microns) is 
required, so we should use a stock thicker than 42 mm and then machine it down to 42 mm 
with a finishing pass. For example, we can select a stock that’s 45 mm thick and then machine 
it down to 42 mm.
• The two dimensions of 110 mm don’t require a particular surface finish and they have a large 
tolerance either (±0.5 mm), so we may leave them unmachined. Leaving them unmachined 
means that we can use a stock of 110 x 110 x 45 mm. Of course, just in case we cannot find  
a raw material block with such a volume, we can pick a bigger one instead.
• There are features on both sides of the part, so we are forced to set two placements.
• There are several threaded holes, most of which are M8 x 1.25; these shouldn’t be a problem 
with a simple drilling operation. In the center, there is a bigger one (M36 x 4) that we should 
probably machine with a different strategy.
Choosing part placements
 201
• We have no information regarding the number of components we shall produce, but let’s 
suppose a large number is needed.
• There’s no mention of it in the drawing, but the material to be machined is a solid block of 
aluminum 6060.
Now that we have an idea of the shape we are about to machine, we have to understand what the 
best strategy for the part placement on the CNC working bed is. We already know that we need two 
placements, but which side of the stock should be machined first? Let’s find out.
Choosing part placements
When studying part placements, most of the time, we can follow different paths, but some of them 
may be more complex than others. I’m going to explain what I think is the best solution regarding our 
specific example, but it may not be the only solution according to the type of machine at our disposal 
and the holding fixture we intend to use.
So, now that we have seen the part we plan to create in Figure 8.1 , we have to imagine how to move 
from a stock of 110 x 110 x 45 mm to the final shape. As we discovered from the drawing, we have to 
machine both sides of the stock as the features will appear on both sides.
Since most milling operations have to be performed on the rounded side, I would machine this side last:
Figure 8.2: Part placements
As you can see in Figure 8.2 , during the first placement (labeled as #1), I plan to perform the 
following operations:
• Back side facing
• Circular slot milling
• Drilling and threading the holes
We covered all of these in Chapter 6 ; however, in the following chapters, we will explore them deeply 
while setting up the operations via the CAM module.
Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 202
After these operations, the first placement will be completely machined and the stock can be flipped 
and mounted upside down so that we can continue to machine the other side. The second placement 
(labeled as #2) contains all the major operations:
• Front side facing
• Circular hole milling and threading
• Milling of the round faces (we will have to implement a roughing and a finishing operation)
Please note that since the central threaded hole is accessible from both sides of the stock, we may 
decide to machine it during the first placement or the second placement, or both. Since thread milling 
can be quite complicated, I decided to leave it as the last operation (we will cover it in Chapter 10 ).
Now that we know what types of operations are involved, we can start thinking about the best way to 
hold the stock while machining it.
Choosing a part fixture
How do you fix a stock to the machine working area? There is no all-encompassing rule, but we can 
say that we should always try to take advantage of the part's shape to lock it onto the working area.
Let’s review the part again to find some possible solutions:
Figure 8.3: 3D view of the part
At first glance, a simple and cheap solution would be to use a stock vise to hold it from the squared 
unmachined faces.
As shown in Figure 8.4 , using a large set of vises to hold the stock is a good solution during the first 
placement since there is a large contact area between the faces:
Choosing a part fixture
 203
Figure 8.4: Part fixture
During the second placement, however, the same vises not only provide a smaller contact area that may 
lead to vibrations but they may also collide with the cutting tool performing the exterior machining.
Since we said that a large number of parts have to be machined, we may have to try a different  
solution – one that is a bit more complex. The solution I would pick is to realize a template to hold 
the stock in position.
Note
A machined template to hold the part in place can be quite expensive, sometimes even more 
than the part itself, so it becomes a viable option if we can charge its price on a large production 
batch of parts.
As shown in Figure 8.5 , after the first placement, we machined a circular slot ( ∅80) with several threaded 
holes. The idea is to take advantage of this feature to hold the part in place. To wrap things up, in the 
following figure, we can find a recap of how the operation is going to be performed:
Figure 8.5: Advanced part fixture
The first placement ( #1) is held in place with a typical set of vises. During the first placement, we 
machine a circular slot with several threaded holes.
Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 204
To hold the stock in place during the second placement ( #2), we decided to create a custom template (in 
the center of the figure) that will hold the stock in place while taking advantage of the threaded holes.
Please note that during the second placement, the stock is held from the bottom with screws so that 
there is complete access to the entire outer shape. This will allow us to use a bigger tool to improve 
machining time and costs.
Another typical way of reducing costs is to machine the two placements together. This way, at every 
machine stop, we have a complete part machined that we can pick from our CNC and put in a box 
and a new first placement stock that we can install onto the template for the second placement; then, 
we can repeat this cycle.
Note
We don’t have the time to cover a large number of pages on this topic, but if you want to learn 
more about vises and holding fixtures, I suggest taking a look at this interesting video from 
NYC CNC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7og3lFitpSo .
Now that we have an idea of how the stock is machined and held in place during the placements, we 
can go back to Fusion 360 to create the setup.
Choosing WCS offsets
As we mentioned previously, machining the two placements together can improve productivity 
and reduce overall costs. This takes us to an important choice we must define before any further 
consideration: do we want to perform a single setup for both placements or do we want to set two 
distinct setups each with its own coordinate system?
There is a minor difference between the two, but it is incredibly important to understand. Let’s look 
at the following figure to help us:
Figure 8.6: Single versus multiple setups
Choosing WCS offsets
 205
On the left, we can find a CAM program with a Single Setup  for both placements. This means that the 
two placements are considered by Fusion 360 as a single part to be machined with the same origin for 
the work coordinate system  (WCS ). It is the simplest approach, but it has the dangerous drawback 
of forcing us to precisely fix the two components at the exact location specified inside the G-code 
program; any minor deviation will result in a badly machined geometry.
Note
What is a WCS? We already mentioned this topic but it might be worth highlighting it again: 
a WCS is any coordinate system used to measure the position of the tool. There is not a single 
WCS; we can set as many as we want. As you can guess, the same set of coordinates – let’s say, 
(10;83;51) – applied to a different WCS will result in the tool moving to different locations.
On the right, there is a Two Setups  program. As you can see, there are two disjointed origins with 
two different coordinate systems. It is the most flexible solution because it isn’t as error sensitive as 
the previous case. Why is that? It’s because we can take advantage of WCS offsets .
So, what are WCS offsets? Long story short, they are position bookmarks we can set for reference 
inside our machine. These bookmarks can be used to reset the tool coordinates to zero (basically, this 
means changing the WCS position).
If you have a nerdy background like me, think of WCS offsets as save slots of your favorite video 
game. Inside these save slots, you can store a certain position to be later used as a coordinate system.
Confused? I don’t blame you; this is advanced stuff! I’ll try to better explain how to use them in our 
example step by step:
1. We mount the stock to be machined anywhere onto the working bed using the vises. The machine 
has no idea of where the stock is placed, so we have to save the position of the stock origin.
2. We move the tool (or a measurement probe) until it is positioned exactly on the origin of the 
coordinate system we intend to use for the first placement. For example, if the origin is on one 
of the corners of the stock, we must move the tool until it touches that corner.
3. At this point, we can save this position as WCS Offset number 1 . These coordinates will be 
stored inside the CNC memory. This way, once the CAM program needs to start from the origin 
of the first placement, the machine will know the exact starting point relative to the stock!
4. Now, we can run the CAM program for the first placement.
5. Then, we must flip the machined stock and mount it onto the template for the second placement.
6. Again, the machine doesn’t know where the stock has been moved, so we have to let it know 
where the origin now is. Therefore, we must move the tool until it is positioned on the origin 
of the second placement.
7. This time, we must save this position as WCS Offset number 2 .
8. Now, we can run the CAM program for the second placement.Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 206
Since we are using two setups, we can be sure that both zeroes will be maintained for both placements 
(doing this with a single setup would have been impossible).
Note
Since we have to manually set the zeroes for the two placements, it is a good idea to choose an 
origin located in a spot that’s easy to measure. For example, in our case, I would never pick the 
center of the part; I would go for a sharp corner instead.
To wrap things up, you just have to remember that our CNC doesn’t have eyes – somehow, we have to 
let it know where the stock and its origin are. Therefore, we have to save the position that our CAM 
toolpath will use as a coordinate system into its memory (WCS offsets). If we use two placements with 
one setup and one coordinate system each, we have to save two different WCS offsets.
Now that we understand WCS offsets and the potential of using two setups for a CAM program with 
multiple placements, we can open Fusion 360 and start using the CAM.
Defining the first setup
The manufacturing environment for milling is very similar to the one we explored for turning, and 
we should already be familiar with most of the panels and commands:
Figure 8.7: The two parts to model
Defining the first setup
 207
As you can see, for better clarity, I decided to model two parts: the model on the left is a solid, showing 
how the part should look after the first placement has been completed, while the part on the right is 
the final result after the second placement has been fully worked.
Splitting the part into two distinct models – one for each placement – is not mandatory, but I think 
that considering the part as two distinct parts can be more intuitive for a beginner.
Now, let’s launch the Setup  tab. We should be presented with three panels:
• Setup
• Stock
• Post Process
Just like we have done in previous chapters, we will explore each panel one by one.
Setup tab
On the Setup  tab, we can find the settings for fully defining the WCS placement relative to the model 
and the type of machining we are trying to implement:
Figure 8.8: The Setup tab
Let’s start with the most important setting.
Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 208
First of all, we must be sure that Operation Type  is set to Milling  (and not, for example, Turning ).
After that, since there are multiple bodies in the project, the next thing we must do is specify which 
3D body has to be considered for the operation; the selection box labeled Model  allows us to pick 
only the parts we want to machine. If nothing is picked, it will consider every 3D object as a part to 
be milled. In our example, we have the first placement stock, the final part, and the template, so we 
shall select the first placement solid only.
With the Fixture  option, we can specify the vises that hold the part in place. However, since we are 
about to machine only the top side of the stock, and since my vises are not that tall, I can be pretty 
sure that no collision is going to occur, so we can leave this flag unticked.
Finally, we have to specify the Origin  point for our WCS by selecting a point on the stock or the 
geometry. It is always a good idea to set a point that is easy to measure since we have to manually set 
the zero for our part.
Stock tab
On the Stock  tab, we can specify the dimension of the aluminum block we have to machine:
Figure 8.9: The Stock tab
Defining the first setup
 209
The part we analyzed has a bounding volume of 110 x 110 x 42 mm; however, since the front face and 
the back face are required to have a good surface finish (and most likely a good planar tolerance), I 
plan to use a bigger stock with additional material along the Z axis. To ensure there’s good planarity 
between the two faces, I would add at least 1.5 mm of material to both. Therefore, we should set a 
stock of at least 110 x 110 x 45 mm.
To set the stock bigger than needed, we can set Mode  to Relative size box .
Choosing this option allows us to specify additional material relative to the overall dimensions of the 
part, instead of working with the absolute dimensions of the stock.
By clicking on the Stock Offset Mode  dropdown, we can specify where we want these layers of material 
to be added and how thick they should be.
In this example, since we have to specify different thicknesses on the faces, we can pick Add stock to 
sides, top-bottom  to customize the values independently.
As you can see, I left a Stock Side Offset  of 0 mm since I don’t plan to machine these faces at all, while 
I added 1.5 mm of material to both Stock Top Offset  and Stock Bottom Offset .
To check that everything has been set properly, we can check Stock Dimensions . As intended, we 
discover a stock of 110 x 110 x 45 mm, which is what we wanted.
Post Process tab
There aren’t many commands inside the Post Process  tab, but here, we can find the option for the 
WCS offsets that we need to set:
Figure 8.10: The Post Process tab
Be very careful! Inside this panel, we should be sure that WCS offset  is set to 0 (which is the default 
value). Y ou may be tempted to tick the Multiple WCS Offsets  checkbox. However, do not enable it ; 
this setup will only use one WCS!
Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 210
Note
Please note that WCS offsets get different names during the translation between Fusion 360 and 
the G-code program. Inside Fusion 360, WCS offsets are referred to using plain numbers (0, 1, 
2, and so on), while on almost any G-code flavor, they are converted into G-code commands 
(G54, G55, G56, and so on).
There is nothing else to change in this panel; therefore, we can consider our first setup completed. 
Now, we can set up the second placement.
Defining the second setup
In this section, we have to repeat more or less what we explored during the first setup. However, don’t 
worry – we will only review the important differences from what we’ve already reviewed.
Setup tab
First, let’s look at the Setup  tab again:
Figure 8.11: The Setup tab
Defining the second setup
 211
As you can see, this time, I selected the final part to be machined, and I put the Origin  parameter of 
the stock on the corner of the aluminum block.
This time, with the Fixture  option, we can pick the template fixture that holds the stock in place. This 
way, our simulation will be able to check collisions between the tool and the holding fixture; this is not 
mandatory – if we did things properly, we shouldn’t expect this type of issue – but we can never tell!
Stock tab
On the Stock  tab, we only need to check if the overall dimension of the block is correct:
Figure 8.12: The Stock tab
As you may recall, the stock was 110 x 110 x 45 mm, but we plan to machine the back face during 
the first placement. Therefore, in this second setup, we should set a stock of 110 x 110 x 43.5 mm.
To set the stock dimensions with precision, we can use Relative size box  once again. However, this 
time, we will set Stock Bottom Offset  to 0 since we already machined that face in the previous setup. 
Stock Top Offset  has to be 1.5 mm since we still need to machine the top face.
As always, we can double-check if the overall dimensions are as expected by looking under Stock 
Dimensions . As you will see, it will be 110 x 110 x 43.5 mm. Perfect!
Part Handling and Part Setup for Milling 212
Post Process
Now, let’s move on to the Post Process  tab:
Figure 8.13: The Post Process tab
Here, the only value we should change is WCS offset . We have to change this number from 0 to any 
other value; for our example, we can use 1. It doesn’t matter what number is chosen (if it is supported 
by the post-processor); it will simply store the coordinate system in a different memory slot and won’t 
impact the result.
Note
We don’t have to insert G-code commands inside the WCS offset text box – we simply have 
to add a plain number. It’s the post-processor’s responsibility to convert that number into  
a G-code line.
Once again, be careful and do not tick the Multiple WCS Offsets  option.
Summary
 213
With that, we have completed the second setup! We should have something like this:
Figure 8.14: The Setups folder
As you can see, inside the Setups  folder, we have two setups called Setup1  and Setup2 . Every milling 
operation for the first placement shall be saved inside Setup1 , while every operation for the second 
placement shall be saved inside Setup2 .
Now, we can start looking at milling operations.
Summary
That concludes this chapter! It may have seemed quite complex due to the introduction and usage of WCS 
offsets, but it is way simpler than it sounds; we will clarify this process in the next few chapters. Also, 
despite being a book oriented to CAM novices, the part we are trying to machine is quite complex and 
up until now has offered several examples of analysis that will come in handy in our daily machining.
To recap what we learned, first, we discovered the part we have to machine with our CNC. Then, 
using the drawing, we analyzed the part to understand the best setup strategy. After that, we analyzed 
the needed placements to be able to machine the entire geometry and discovered the best solution 
to hold the part during the second placement. Finally, we created two setups that will be used in the 
following chapters for our milling operations.
In Chapter 9 , we will learn how to implement several milling strategies, such as face milling, shoulder 
milling, drilling, and tapping.
9
Implementing Our  
First Milling Operations
In this chapter, we will implement all the cutting operations to complete the first stock placement 
for our example part. We won’t jump directly to complex 3D operations (which will be covered in 
Chapter 10 ) but rather, we will start from the most common 2D milling strategies of face milling and 
pocket milling.
We will learn how to set up the main 2D milling operations and how to calculate the cutting parameters 
using CoroPlus. While doing this, we will try to have a critical point of view on the proposed solution, 
learning how to optimize the machining time and reducing the number of tool changes in our 
CAM program.
Not only we will learn how to set up milling operations using an online calculator, but we will also 
calculate the cutting parameters by ourselves (step by step), using the equations introduced in Chapter 6 .
The overall goal of this chapter is to get you used to the milling environment of Fusion 360 before 
moving on to more complex operations. This is very important, since jumping directly to fancy 3D 
contouring operations and finishing strategies may lead to confusion and frustration.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Face milling
• Shoulder milling
• Drilling
• TappingImplementing Our First Milling Operations 216
Technical requirements
This chapter is a bit more advanced than the previous ones, so I strongly advise that you read and 
study all the chapters about milling and turning theory so far. Some concepts won’t be explained 
again in the hope that you are already a bit more confident with the basics of CAM interfaces and 
machining operations.
Also, as we will be using CoroPlus for cutting parameters as well as solving equations, a calculator or 
an Excel sheet may be required.
Face milling
As described in Chapter 8  (as shown in Figure 8.2 ), the first milling operation we have to implement 
is facing the top side of the stock; here, we have to remove a layer of 1.5 millimeters of our part.
At the moment, the stock is 45 mm tall, and we need to bring it down to 42 mm by removing 1.5 mm 
from both the top and bottom face, to have a good surface quality. As discussed in Chapter 6 , the 
best strategy to remove a flat layer of material is face milling, a fundamental milling operation that 
allows us to machine flat areas.
Note
Depending on the quality of the stock, we may need to increase the amount of extra material 
to remove for a successful facing operation. The more the stock is bent or irregular, the more 
material we shall remove, and the bigger the stock shall be.
Let’s begin with finding the right tool and parameters using our trusty Sandvik CoroPlus.
Using CoroPlus to find the best tool for face milling and shoulder 
milling
We have  already used CoroPlus for turning; however, this is the first time we are approaching milling, 
therefore a fresh recap about this plugin may be useful.
The first thing we should set is the material of the stock, which in our case is an aluminum alloy 
series 6000. As you can see, we can choose between multiple default materials; every one has a color 
and a letter associated with it. We will select N, which in the Sandvik naming convention stands for 
aluminum alloys.Face milling
 217
Figure 9.1: CoroPlus material selection
Picking the  right material will ensure correct feeds and speeds, and the best  possible optimization of 
the tool material and its coating. Please note that different brands will use different colors and naming 
conventions, so do make sure you are selecting the correct material.
Now, we have to select the right task to be implemented. This can be found in the same panel we 
already used for turning; however, this time, instead of picking Symmetrical rotating , we will go 
for Non-rotating .
Figure 9.2: CoroPlus task selection
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 218
Now, we will be able to see every milling operation we will ever need:
Figure 9.3: CoroPlus operation selection
There  are a variety of categories we can select, but since we have to machine a flat surface with our 
facing operation, we shall pick Plain surface and shoulder  (as you may recall, face milling and shoulder 
milling have many features in common, and therefore, they often are listed together).
Then, CoroPlus requires us to get even more specific with details. As you can see, we can find 
the Plain surface  and Plain surface with interrupted cut  options. These are the only two facing 
operations available.
Figure 9.4: CoroPlus operation selection
Face milling
 219
Plain surface with interrupted cut  is better optimized for uneven surfaces with lots of interruptions 
on the path that may lead to pulsating loads on the tool. However, Plain surface  is the one we shall 
pick right now; our stock is perfectly smooth at the moment, since it is still unmachined.
It is now time to specify the cutting operation we plan to implement:
Figure 9.5: CoroPlus facing operation details
Let’s go through the options that we need to consider:
• With Operation type , we can specify whether we want to create a roughing operation (called 
Pre-machining ) or a roughing and finishing operation (called Pre-machining and finishing ). 
Just for the sake of completeness, we will implement both operations; therefore, we shall pick 
Pre-machining and finishing  from the drop-down menu.
• The layer we need to remove from the top of the stock is 1.5 millimeters, so we set that value 
for the Depth of machining feature  option.
• Our stock is 110 x 110, so we can enter those values in General width parameter  and General 
length parameter  respectively.
• A useful parameter to set is Ra roughness value on the bottom ; since our 2D drawing requires 
a roughness of 3.2 mm, we can specify that as well.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 220
Note
Roughness is quite a complex attribute to understand and measure. To have an idea of what 
roughness is, we can say that it is a way of expressing a value related to the microscopic 
imperfections of a surface. As you may imagine, we cannot simply take a ruler and measure 
the roughness of a part. To do it properly, we need multiple measurements, along with a bit 
of math and statistics. There are several approaches to measuring roughness; here, we find 
roughness Ra , and in Chapter 10 , we will mention roughness Rz . However, we don’t have 
time to cover them in this book. If you want to read more about them, check out https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_roughness .
• We do not have a Maximum cutting diameter  value to specify, since we shouldn’t have any 
leftover radius, as we are machining the entire face.
Now, we can simply hit Get results  to let CoroPlus evaluate the best cutting strategy:
Figure 9.6: The first facing proposal
As we can immediately spot from the tool preview, CoroPlus is suggesting a typical facing tool with 
a KAPR of 45°, which is perfect for face milling; however, there is a catch.
As we can see from the picture, right after the face milling operation (#1), we have to create a circular 
pocket in the center of the stock (#2). Therefore, using the same tool for both operations may reduce 
machining time by avoiding tool changes.
Face milling
 221
Figure 9.7: The shoulder operation
A tool with a KAPR of 45° is perfect for face milling, but it is not capable of milling the central slot. 
Instead, we  want to machine the highlighted area ( #2) with the same tool; therefore, we shall reject 
any tool with a 45° KAPR and pick one with a 90° entering angle (KAPR).
Moving back to Figure 9.6 , on the right, we can find a list of alternative tools we can use. These tools 
have not been suggested as the first choice, since they feature a less-than-ideal optimization for the 
operation we configured in CoroPlus.
We want to  look for the first one with a 90° KAPR; it won’t be the best one for face milling, but it will 
save us a tool change. Scrolling through the list of alternative tools, the most appropriate one is called 
R390-040A32-11H . Y ou can find out more about it here: https://www.sandvik.coromant.
com/it-it/products/pages/productdetails.aspx?c=r390-040a32-11h .
Since this tool has replaceable inserts, we also have to pick inserts as well. We have a large choice of 
inserts for this tool, but I would choose the following model, which is specific for aluminum alloys – 
R390-11 T3 08E-NL H13A . Y ou can find more details on these inserts at the following link: https://
www.sandvik.coromant.com/it-it/products/pages/productdetails.
aspx?c=R390-11%20T3%2008E-NL%20%20%20H13A .
Note
Once upon a time, tools and inserts were squared and made of High-Speed Steel  (HSS ); today, 
there is always a wide range of geometries, materials, and coatings to select from instead. Every 
geometry, material, and coating may be better in certain situations with certain materials. In our 
case, for example, we picked the insert that offers the best performance when milling aluminum.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 222
To re-evaluate  the cutting parameters with this new tool and insert them, we simply click on the tool 
from the list:
Figure 9.8: The new facing operation
As you can  see, the  same operation performed with this different tool ( R390-040A32-11H ) is taking 
around 8 seconds, instead of 6 seconds with the previous tool ( RA245-076R25-12H ). However, since 
a tool change would require way more time than 2 seconds, we should definitely opt for a common 
tool for both operations; this way, the productivity will increase, since the overall time will be reduced!
Now that we finally defined the tool to use, we can look for cutting parameters. If we click on Show 
detail , we can find even more pieces of information we will need to set later inside Fusion 360:
Face milling
 223
Figure 9.9: The cutting parameter extended details
Please  note that, this time, we spent a great number  of pages on how to use CoroPlus; since all future 
operations will be more or less the same, we will skip repeating the entire procedure. However, if you 
don’t want to go for CoroPlus, you can still use the formulas explained in Chapter 6 ; this will be a bit 
more difficult and will require a bit more trial and error, but it is definitely possible!
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 224
Implementing face milling with Fusion 360
It is now  time to jump back to Fusion 360. We can find the command for facing (called Face ) under 
the MILLING  tab inside the 2D drop-down menu.
Figure 9.10: The Face command
As we can see, there are many other commands in the list; we won’t cover them all, since some are very 
specific. However, as we progress through the book, we will try to use as many of them as possible.
For now, we will start with the Face  command. Now, let’s explore the different tabs.
The Tool tab
The first panel is called To ol . Here, we have to specify most of the cutting parameters and the tool to 
use (please note that we won’t cover tool creation and tool import, since we should already be quite 
skilled at it).
Face milling
 225
Figure 9.11: FACE’s Tool tab
In the Feed & Speed  section, there  are many values to specify; however, most of them are connected. 
Therefore, changing one will modify one or more of the others as well. Here, we just need to set Spindle 
Speed  to 7850  rpm and Cutting Feedrate  to 7070 mm/min , as suggested by CoroPlus, and Fusion 
360 will fill the other values for us.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 226
Geometry tab
The Geometry  tab is  quite slim; we simply have to specify the outer contour for our facing operation.
Figure 9.12: FACE’s Geometry tab
Using Stock Selections , pick the top face of the stock we need to machine, as shown in the following figure:
Figure 9.13: The contour selection
We can leave the tab called Heights , as the default values should already be good to go, and move 
directly to the tab called Passes , which is full of useful options we need to tweak.
The Passes tab
Inside this tab, we have to specify the remaining cutting parameters and several options that will 
shape the generated toolpath.
Face milling
 227
Figure 9.14: FACE’s Passes tab
It is definitely  worth a detailed look at the most important commands:
• Pass Direction Reference  and Pass Direction  allow us to set the direction of the table feed. 
Most of the time, these settings are not critical; however, we should always consider that at 
every cutting pass, the tool will extend beyond the stock contour. Therefore, we shall check 
that the tool won’t collide with something else.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 228
Figure 9.15: Pass direction
As you can see from the figure, on the right of the stock machined during the first placement, 
there is the stock that will be machined during the second placement. Therefore, choosing 
a cutting direction along the Y axis might be a good idea to solve the problem. For the Pass 
Direction Reference  setting, we shall then pick any edge parallel to the Y axis and leave Pass 
Direction  at 0°.
• Pass Extension  and Stock Offset  specify how much the tool will extend beyond the stock 
limit. Extending the cutting pass beyond the stock will help if we are unsure about the stock’s 
dimensions, and we want to be sure to machine it entirely, even if it is a bit bigger than the ideal 
volume. In this case, I decided to add 25 millimeters for Pass Extension  (but we probably could 
have used way less). Extending the toolpath via Pass Extension  will increase the toolpath along 
the cutting direction only, while using Stock Offset  can increase the toolpath in all directions. 
This time, I think we can safely leave the stock offset at zero.
• Stepover  is a fancy way of referring to the radial cutting depth value; therefore, we can simply 
insert the calculated value of 36.67 mm .
• Direction  allows us to specify the type of milling; we can opt for Climb , Conventional , or 
Both . Unless we are looking for maximum production speed, we should always opt for Climb , 
since it will give us less tool wear and better surface quality.
• From Other Side  will flip the enter and exit points on our toolpath. There is no real need to 
use this option for our example; therefore, we will leave it untouched.
• Use Chip Thinning  is used to create a curved entering path to the stock; it is useful to reduce 
tool loads and chattering. I don’t plan to use it for the example part, but if you want to read more 
on the subject, I suggest you take a look at the following post: https://gorillamill.
com/blog/chip-thinning/ .
Shoulder milling
 229
• Multiple Depths  allows  you to fine-tune the thickness of material removed by every cutting 
pass and introduce a finishing pass with a specific cutting depth. In our case, we will enable 
this option to get a better surface finish. Please note that we will use a separate finishing pass 
for training purposes only, since we may machine the upper face in only one pass.
• Maximum Stepdown  is the maximum cutting depth permitted by our tool; in our case, it is 10 
mm. This would have been a critical value to set if we had to machine a thicker layer of material.
• Finishing Stepdown  is the cutting depth of the final finishing pass. In our case, we have to 
remove 1 mm of material as a roughing pass and a layer of 0.5 mm as a finishing pass; therefore, 
we only have to enter a value of 0.5  mm.
• Finishing Feedrate  is the feed value for the final finishing pass only, which in our case 
is 6300mm/min .
There we have it – our first milling operation has been finally implemented. Now that we have machined 
the top face of our stock, we can focus on the remaining operations.
Shoulder milling
For our second milling operation – shoulder milling – we will machine the circular slot in the center 
of our part:
Figure 9.16: The slot profile
It has a diameter of 80 millimeters and a depth of 10 millimeters. As mentioned before, we will use 
the same tool already used for the first facing operation.
Calculating the cutting parameters by hand
Before  launching the command on Fusion 360, we should evaluate the cutting parameters. However, 
the bad news is that this time, instead of using CoroPlus, we will try to calculate them on our own. 
Be sure of this – it will be a bit trickier but way more satisfying!
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 230
First of all, we should understand our machine specifications:
• We will use a Haas VF-1
• The maximum cutting power is around 22.4 kW
• Its maximum rated spindle speed is 8,100 RPM
• The maximum torque is obtained at 2,000 RPM with a value of 122 Nm
These values will be needed to check if our machine is powerful enough and can sustain the cutting 
parameters we calculated via the equations.
After that, we should briefly study the details of the cutting insert we are using. Y ou can find all the 
necessary details using the following URL: https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/itit/

From the URL, we have discovered that the insert is specifically designed for aluminum milling and 
that the suggested cutting values are the
Here,   is the feed per tooth, and   is the cutting speed at the maximum diameter, which for our 
tool is 40 mm.
Please note that we should consider these values more like a starting point for our cutting operation. 
If for any reason our operation will lead to a bad result, we may need to tweak them a little bit.
Now, using the formula for cutting speed, we can get the spindle speed:
We know  ; therefore, we can flip the formula and get  :
This value of the spindle speed is less than the maximum spindle speed granted by our machine (8,100 
RPM); therefore, this is a good start. We can move forward to the next formula to calculate the table feed:
Where   is the  feed per tooth, for which Sandvik suggested starting with a value of 0.15 mm,   is the 
spindle speed we just obtained, and   is the effective number of engaged teeth.=0.15  
=990 /  
=1000 
=∗1000 =7878  
=∗∗ Shoulder milling
 231
We already know that the actual number of teeth may change according to the geometry and radial 
cutting depth (if you don’t remember why, please check Figure 6.8 ); however, to keep things simple, we 
will consider that all six teeth of our tool will be engaged all the time. This way, we will overestimate 
the required cutting power for a better safety margin. Therefore, if we insert the values in the previous 
equation, we obtain the following:
Now, we have calculated  , and this is an important achievement, but we still need to solve one more 
equation, the cutting power equation. We can use the power equation to link all the cutting parameters 
together; this way, we can calculate unknown parameters.
Here, we can find the power formula in all its glory:
These are the values we have to play with:
•   is the axial depth of the cut. The slot we have to machine is 10 millimeters deep, which 
is also the maximum axial cutting depth supported by our tool; therefore, we may decide to 
machine the entire slot with a single cutting pass!
•   is the table feed we just calculated.
•   is a value related to the specific cutting force needed to cut material at a certain feed. It is 
quite difficult to calculate properly, depending on the alloy, the treatment of the surface, and 
the cutting feed. However, for our example, we can consider it to be around 650 Mpa.
•   is a safety factor, used to consider friction and other variables that cannot be considered in 
formulas; most of the time, we can consider it to be between 0.7 and 0.8.
•   is the required cutting power for the operation with these parameters. It shouldn’t be greater 
than our maximum spindle power (which, for the example, is 22.4 kW).
•   is the radial cutting depth (which we are currently missing).
Let’s write down all the values we know inside a formula:
As you can see, there is only one missing parameter,  ; therefore, we can calculate it.=0.15∗7878 ∗6 =7090.2 /

60∗106∗0.75 Implementing Our First Milling Operations 232
If we do the math, we get   as 21.87 mm! However, there is a problem with this result. Sure, it is  
a solution to the cutting power formula; however, it breaks the golden rule of milling!
If you  remember Figure 6.13 , we should never engage the tool at a radial cutting depth close to half 
the diameter; a much better idea is to set it to 1/3 (13.33 mm) or 2/3 (26.67 mm).
Since a value of 26.67 mm is higher than 21.87 mm, we cannot use it, as our machine won’t have 
enough power to cut with the other specified parameters.
Using the cutting power formula, we can reach the following conclusions:
• We can reduce the axial cutting depth to 8.2 mm and machine with a radial cutting depth of 
26.67 mm
• Alternatively, we can use an axial cutting depth of 10 mm (the maximum for our tool) and  
a radial cutting depth of 13.33 mm (with an overall required power of 13.7 kW)
The first option may be better if we plan to implement a roughing operation that will remove 8.2 mm 
and a finishing operation that will remove 1.8 mm. However, if we check the part drawing presented 
in Figure 8.1  in Chapter 8 , we will find that there isn’t a particular tight tolerance on dimensions or 
the surface finish on the sides or bottom of the circular slot we are about to machine. Therefore, I 
would opt for the second option – machining at a higher axial cutting depth; this way, we can save 
time machining in a single pass only.
Note:
Since this is a blind slot, we shall also calculate the cutting parameters used when the tool is 
plunging inside the stock. We will omit this part here, however we are going to mention helical 
movements in Chapter 10 .
Now, we should also calculate the required cutting torque with the following formula:
To check whether this value is still plausible at 7,878 RPM, we would need a torque diagram (such as 
those found for vehicles); however, since this value is well below the maximum rated value, I think it 
is worth a first attempt at machining!
Please note that these formulas are considered a rule of thumb, and they may lead to a few trials 
and errors. If we get excessive tool bending or other issues while milling, we may have to adjust the 
parameters a bit.
That was the last formula we needed, so we can now move back to Fusion 360!=∗954 9=13.7∗954 9
787 8 =16.6  Shoulder milling
 233
Shoulder milling inside Fusion 360
There are a couple of commands that can be used for shoulder milling inside Fusion 360; the first and 
most used is called 2D Adaptive Clearing , while the other is called 2D Pocket .
Note
If you find a command labeled Adaptive , it usually refers to the fact that such a command 
generates a better cutting path with an even tool load during the entire cutting operation.
Y ou can find these commands in the following panel:
Figure 9.17: The 2D Adaptive Clearing command
Both of them are very similar; however, we will use 2D Adaptive Clearing .
Tool tab
The first thing to do after launching the command is to fill in all the calculated cutting parameters 
in the To ol  tab:
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 234
Figure 9.18: Adaptive clearing’s Tool tab
After picking the same tool we used for the previous milling operation, we simply need to set Spindle 
Speed  as 7878 rpm , Cutting Feedrate  as 7090 mm/min , and Feed per Revolution  as 0.9 mm.
After this, we can move directly to the next tab called Geometry .
The Geometry tab
In this tab, we have to specify the geometries to be included for toolpath generation, hence its name.
Shoulder milling
 235
Figure 9.19: Adaptive clearing’s Geometry tab
Using the options available in this panel, we have to specify the working area for our shoulder milling 
operation. With Contour Mode  and Pocket Selections , we have to manually specify every face to 
be machined one by one. In our example, this shouldn’t be a problem, since we only have one pocket 
to be machined; all we have to do is click on the contour of the cylindrical face, as shown in the 
following figure:
Figure 9.20: Pocket selection
Then, with Extension Method , we can specify how to approach open geometries and generate the 
toolpath around the faces. This is quite an advanced option and quite difficult to understand. However, 
since our pocket is closed, we don’t really have to specify anything; we can leave the default setting 
to Tangent .
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 236
The Stock Contours  option allows us to specify a restricted working area to avoid our tool moving 
into unwanted areas. Since the pocket we are about to machine is closed and completely inside the 
stock bounding box, we can leave this option unchecked.
Rest Machining  is a useful option that permits us to machine areas where a previous operation couldn’t 
remove material. For example, let’s imagine we implemented a roughing pass using a tool with a big 
diameter. The finishing pass will be performed with a much smaller tool. Enabling this option will 
allow the tool to machine areas untouched by previous operations. Once again, this isn’t applicable 
in our case; therefore, we shouldn’t set this flag either.
We can leave the Heights  panel with the default values and move on to the Passes  panel for the last 
parameters to be set.
The Passes tab
Inside this panel, we can finalize the cutting passes for our operation:
Figure 9.21: Adaptive clearing’s Passes panel
Shoulder milling
 237
We will now review the most important options available here:
• Optimal Load  is the value of our radial cutting depth, which is 13.33 millimeters. Please note 
that this value is more of a suggestion that we are giving to Fusion 360. It will try to respect 
this value; however, due to geometry or tool shape, it may be forced to use a different value 
when machining certain areas!
• Both Ways  is an option that allows us to specify whether we intend to use both climb and 
conventional milling, however you should never go for this option; please remember, as 
discovered in Chapter 6 , to always use climb milling if possible.
• Minimum Cutting Radius  is an advanced option to convert every sharp corner inside the tool 
path into a softer curve with a fillet radius. Whether our technology is milling, laser cutting, 
or 3D printing, sudden changes in direction along the toolpath (for example, on corners) are 
always to be avoided if possible, since they can cause vibrations. With this option, we can 
automatically convert sharp corners into tiny smooth fillets. For our example, there aren’t sharp 
corners; therefore, we don’t have to tick this flag.
• Use Slot Clearing  is an option that we should always check when machining a small pocket 
(or slot) with tight tolerances. We already covered the idea behind this type of operation in 
Chapter 6 , which you can see in Figure 6.15 .
• With Direction , we can specify whether we intend to use Climb  milling or Conventional  
milling; we should always leave the default value set to Climb .
• Multiple Depths  allows us to specify several cutting passes and an optional finishing pass. 
Since we are planning to machine the entire slot at an axial cutting depth of 10 mm, we will 
machine it with a single pass.
• Stock to Leave  is the option that allows us to leave a thin layer of material above our geometry 
for future machining; in our case, we don’t need it.
Moving on from the Passes  tab, the Linking  tab contains many options related to toolpath optimization 
when moving from one cutting pass to the other; however, it is a bit too advanced and we won’t cover 
it. Don’t worry – most of the time, we can leave the default settings untouched! We will approach this 
advanced tab in Chapter 10 .
Now that we have filled all the required parameters and options, we can check the resulting simulation; 
at this point, we have the first two milling operations completed:Implementing Our First Milling Operations 238
Figure 9.22: Simulation
As we can find from the preceding figure, the machined area is green, meaning that we removed the 
right amount of material from the stock. From the Verification  tab, we can see that no collisions were 
found. Everything seemed to go as intended. We now just need to drill the eight holes and machine 
the threads, which we will do in the next section.
Drilling
We fully covered the drilling operation in Chapter 5 , for our turning example. The command is the 
same for milling as well; therefore, we will skip a long introduction regarding the panels and just cover 
the required settings for the example.
So, as before, let’s look at the To ol  tab first.
Drilling
 239
The Tool tab
Inside this panel, we  can specify the tool to use and the main cutting parameters:
Figure 9.23: Drilling’s Tool tab
The first thing we have to set is the cutting tool, which for a drilling operation is a drill bit. Since the 
holes will need to be threaded, we have to create a pilot with a certain diameter. The thread we will 
have to tap is an M8; therefore, the pilot hole shall have a diameter of 6.8 mm.
So, as you can see from the preceding screenshot, we have to pick a drill bit with a diameter of 6.8 mm.
Now that we have chosen the right tool, we can focus on the cutting parameters. Clicking on the drop-
down menu called Preset , we can pick a suitable set of parameters for drilling operations according 
to the material; in this case, we can select Aluminum - Drilling .
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 240
The Geometry tab
Inside  this tab, we have to pick the geometry to be machined; therefore, we shall select every hole on 
the 3D model.
Figure 9.24: Drilling’s Geometry tab
If we don’t want to select every hole one by one, we can select the first one by using Hole Faces  and 
then flag the option called Select Same Diameter . Fusion should automatically discover all the holes 
to machine; however, this option may fail if the geometry is complex or non-cylindrical.
The Heights tab
In this  tab, we can find many options to set the working height of the tool when it is outside the part 
(for example, the clearance height or the retract height), but we can also specify how deep the drill 
bit will go when plunging inside the stock.
Drilling
 241
Figure 9.25: Drilling’s Heights tab
As you can see, there is an option called Drill Tip Through Bottom . What is that all about? The origin 
of drilling tools is on the tip of the tool; therefore, it will move to the bottom of the hole, resulting in 
a bad hole shape. If we want to create a hole that goes straight through the part, we have to make sure 
that the tip of the bit will move below the bottom of the hole.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 242
Let’s look at the following diagram:
Figure 9.26: Drilling options
In this diagram, we  can see the following:
• On the left, where Drill Tip Through Bottom  is disabled, the drill bit just came up to the 
bottom of the hole; once retracted, the result is a blind hole.
• In the center, Drill Tip Through Bottom  is enabled, and the hole should result in a perfectly 
cylindrical shape, since the tip goes below the bottom of the hole.
• On the right, using Break-Through Depth , we specified a minor offset for extra safety to be 
sure the tool goes through the entire stock. This is the option we will pick, along with an offset 
of 5 millimeters.
It is now time to take a look at Cycle .
The Cycle tab
Inside  this tab, we can specify the type of drilling operation we want to implement and its settings.
Drilling
 243
Figure 9.27: Drilling’s Cycle tab
Since we have to drill the pilot holes, as Cycle Type , we could go for Drilling - rapid out  (the same 
operation we implemented in the turning example). However, since the holes are quite small and deep, 
I’ d rather pick Deep drilling - full retract . With this operation, we have much more control over how 
the drill bit will plunge into the hole; in particular, we can specify pecking settings.
Pecking  is a chip management strategy particularly useful for deep and small holes. That’s because, 
with this type of drilling, there is a high amount of chip produced.
When the hole is very narrow and deep, it gets more difficult to remove the chip. The reason is quite 
simple – the chip will be more prone to getting trapped at the bottom of the hole.
With pecking, we can drill only a fraction of the hole and then retract the tool to evacuate most of the 
chip stuck inside the hole. After the first retraction, the drill bit will plunge again into the hole and 
keep drilling, without the bother of excessive amounts of chip.
Looking back at Figure 9.27 , Pecking Depth  can be adjusted according to the tool and the depth of 
cut. As a rule of thumb, we can drill a hole up to a depth of around three or four times the drill bit 
diameter without any issues. Therefore, in our example, I chose a Pecking Depth  setting of 21 mm.
Then, the more the hole depth increases, the more we need pecking, and the more we have to reduce 
the pecking distance. To control pecking passes according to the drilling depth, we can introduce a 
Pecking Depth Reduction  setting of around twice the diameter (a value of 10–14 millimeters may 
be a good first approach).
After a while, as long as the hole depth increases, we can no longer reduce the pecking depth, as the 
hole is simply too deep; therefore, we reach a Minimum Pecking Depth  value that has to be maintained 
down to the bottom of the hole.
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 244
A typical  value for such a minimum pecking depth is the same or less than the drill bit diameter. In our 
case, I think we should set a smaller minimum pecking depth, so I will go for a value of 5 millimeters.
With Dwell Before Retract  and Dwelling Period , we can let the tool spinning at the bottom of the 
hole for a few instants; this is usually done for a better surface finish on the bottom of the hole. In our 
case, since we are machining through holes, we can leave these options unchecked.
There are many concepts to properly master pecking and dwelling, which we won’t cover in this book; 
however, there is a very interesting video by Haas Automation on the subject that you should definitely 
take a look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM6nVgKjBQo .
Congratulations! The first placement is almost completed, but we still need to thread the holes using 
a tap!
Tapping
There is not a dedicated command for tapping, so we have to use the drilling command instead. Since 
we just reviewed the command for drilling, we will just cover the important settings for tapping.
We have to thread the first 20 millimeters of the holes with an ISO M8 x 1.25 thread. To do this, we 
have to choose a tap with the same pitch and diameter. Luckily, there are many tapping tools at our 
disposal in the default tool library; therefore, we don’t have to create or import a new tool.
Figure 9.28: Drilling’s Tool tab (used for Tapping)
Tapping
 245
CoroPlus suggests a Spindle Speed  setting of 1360  RPM, resulting in a Surface Speed  setting of 
34.1805 m/min , so all we have to do is input those values inside the  panel.
Then, we have to specify all of the holes to machine using the Geometry  panel; we won’t repeat this 
procedure, since it’s identical to how we drilled the pilot holes in the last section.
However, we should go to the Heights  panel, where we can specify the thread length.
Figure 9.29: Drilling’s Heights tab (used for Tapping)
The planes  specified inside this panel define the working boundaries for the cutting operation; therefore, 
in order to set the maximum tapping depth (thread length), we have to set the Bottom Height  plane 
at the maximum level to be reached by our tap. In particular, we need to specify the bottom plane to 
be measured from the hole top and set an offset of -20 mm .
Implementing Our First Milling Operations 246
After setting the working boundaries, we can move to the Cycle  tab:
Figure 9.30: Drilling’s Cycle tab (used for Tapping)
Since we are threading a part, we should set Cycle Type  to Tapping . Please note that there are also 
other  tapping operations that will result in different G-code commands; you should pick the one that 
fits your CNC machine and its post-processor the best.
It is now time to run a simulation of the entire setup and analyze the results:
Figure 9.31: Simulation
First of all, inside the Verification  panel, we can find that no collisions occurred, which is always a good 
start. Then, we can find that every face of the stock is painted green, so we know that we machined 
the right amount of material from the stock.
Summary
 247
As you may have noticed, the holes are depicted in red. Is it an error? Don’t worry – it isn’t. When 
modeling using Fusion 360, holes have the dimension of the pilot hole (in our case, 6.8 millimeters).
Once the tap enters the hole to machine it, it will increase its diameter up to M8; therefore, the 
simulation results in a warning of negative material on the face and it will display it in red. To cut  
a long story short, Fusion 360 thinks that we removed too much material, since the original pilot hole 
was 6.8 mm, but in reality, we simply threaded the holes to M8.
Another critical point to check is the Work offset  setting, which at the moment is set to G54, which 
is a reference to the origin of the first placement (as discussed in Chapter 8 ). When simulating the 
next placement, we should check the that work offset matches the origin of the second placement.
Also, as an  interesting side note, we can check from the simulation panel that the entire machining 
took a little more than 2 minutes and we had to use three tools. This is useful to calculate the costs 
for the part in relation to machining time.
Everything is looking fine; therefore, we can move confidently to the next stock placement, where we 
will machine more complex geometries.
Summary
That concludes this chapter. I hope that the extra effort required for the equations was worth it; now, 
we don’t really need online tools anymore (even if they are still valuable).
In summary, we first set up face milling using CoroPlus. Then, we decided to change the suggested 
cutting tool and opt for one capable of machining the round pocket in the center of the stock.
After the first facing operation was implemented in Fusion 360, we moved to the circular slot in the 
center of the part and calculated all the required cutting parameters, using the milling equations.
After completing the milling operations, we moved to drilling and tapping. First, we found out how 
to drill holes using the same drilling command already introduced in Chapter 5 , but this time, we 
mentioned a chip evacuation technique called pecking. After drilling the holes, we moved on to tapping 
and found out how to set the thread length and check for errors in the final simulation.
In this chapter, we didn’t implement fancy 3D contouring operations. Instead, we started with basic 
operations such as face milling and shoulder milling; however, these milling strategies are really 
common and really powerful.
Now, follow me to the next chapter, where we are about to complete the example part by machining 
the second placement of our stock!10
Machining the Second 
Placement
This chapter directly follows on from the previous one since we will start right where we left off before. 
Now that we have completed all the milling operations on the first placement (the first setup), we can 
focus on the second placement by implementing all the remaining operations that will result in the 
final shape of the part.
What we are about to do is clearly depicted in the following figure:
Figure 10.1: The second placement
The partially machined stock has now been flipped and installed onto the fixture we mentioned in 
Chapter 8 . With this second placement, we will machine the opposite side of the part. We will now 
cover every remaining cutting operation one by one.
The goal of this chapter is to introduce more complex operations than those found in Chapter 9 , leading 
you closer and closer to a real case scenario with an ever-increasing level of complexity. We will also 
try to analyze minor details that may hide potential issues if not handled correctly.
Machining the Second Placement 250
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Face milling
• Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
• Milling a hole
• Finishing the part using a morphed spiral
• Thread milling
Technical requirements
In order to follow this chapter and get the most out of it, you should have read all the previous chapters 
and have a clear idea of the milling operations introduced in Chapter 6  and Chapter 9 .
Since we already covered several ways of calculating the cutting parameters, we won’t focus on how 
to get them anymore; therefore, you should already be capable of calculating the parameters and 
choosing the right tool yourself. Of course, it is also possible to simply copy and paste the tools and 
the values used here.
Face milling
The first milling operation we should set up is, once again, face milling; in this case, we have to remove 
a layer of 1.5 mm on the top of the stock. We won’t cover this operation here since it is identical to 
the first one we introduced in Chapter 9 ; therefore, we may keep using the same tool and the same 
cutting parameters.
After the first facing, we should find something similar to this:
Figure 10.2: Face milling
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
 251
As we can see, the diagram displays both the cutting tool and the generated toolpath for the first face 
milling I implemented. We already know every setting from Chapter 9 ; therefore, I won’t bother you 
with a recap of what we did last time. However, this time I changed something in the settings. Let’s 
try to discover what I changed just by looking at the toolpath:
• First of all, we can find an entry point close to the origin of the coordinate system, highlighted 
by the red cone pointed downward (to the left of the image), and an exit point highlighted by 
a green cone pointed upward (to the right of the image).
• Then we can spot that the cutting operation is performed with four parallel movements 
performed in the same direction; from that, we can conclude that the milling tool will most 
likely machine the stock with up milling only or down milling only and not both (if you need 
a recap on the differences between these types of machining, please go back to Figure 6.7 ). We 
can affirm this since the tool, after completing every cutting pass, retracts to a safe height and 
repositions to perform the next cutting pass in the same direction.
• In addition, we can identify that the cutting movements extend quite a bit beyond the stock limit. 
Up to this point, we cannot spot any difference from the face milling operation in Chapter 9 .
• The only difference we can spot from the toolpath is the number of cutting passes. Since there 
is only a single set of blue lines, we can deduce that there is not a roughing pass and a finishing 
pass, but the entire layer of material removed is machined in just one pass.
That was not bad for just a glance at a preview picture!
We can now move on to the next milling operation needed to roughly machine the 3D shape of the 
part for future finishing operations.
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive 
clearing
Now that we have machined the top of the stock, it is time to move on to a roughing operation on the 
complex shape of our part. The goal of this operation is to remove most of the material around it and 
leave just a tiny bit for the next finishing operation.Machining the Second Placement 252
Long story short, we have to create something similar to a South American pyramid:
Figure 10.3: Steps on the side of our part
As you can see, there are multiple steps all along the sides of the part. The bigger the steps, the faster 
this roughing operation will be. However, please remember that a finishing operation is not capable 
of removing much material; therefore, we should find some sort of sweet spot between optimizing 
the roughing passes and the finishing passes. For this operation, we will aim for each step to be 2 mm.
Before starting with the command and settings, we should ask ourselves what the best tool to pick is 
and whether there are certain constraints it should respect. From my point of view, there aren’t many 
hidden troubles in the geometry, so we should simply pick a tool long enough to machine up to the 
bottom of the part (which is 42 mm tall).
Deciding the tool diameter is a bit trickier; the diameter should be the biggest possible yet small 
enough to fit the internal fillets of the part. In the following diagram, we can find the fillets we have 
to machine with our tool:
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
 253
Figure 10.4: Fillets
As you can see in the diagram, a tool with a diameter of 20 mm would barely fit the shape of the part; 
therefore, since we also have to leave a bit of material for the finishing operation, we should pick a 
smaller tool. In this case, I will go for a 16 mm tool: it perfectly fits the part, and it is still quite a strong 
tool capable of heavy loads and a high material removal ratio. Of course, we may also pick smaller 
tools, but they will probably be less effective.
The tool  I decided to use for this operation is called 1P260-1600-XA 1620 , and it is a carbide 
end mill particularly suitable for heavy roughing. Y ou can find more details at the following link: 
https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/products/pages/productdetails.
aspx?c=1p260-1600-xa%201620 .
Why did I choose this tool? There are multiple reasons; first of all, its cutting diameter is 16 mm, it is a 
heavy-duty tool capable of a high material removal ratio, which is a perfect fit for a roughing strategy 
via shoulder milling, and finally, it has a maximum axial cutting depth of 50 mm, meaning that we 
may machine the entire height of the stock in one single pass.
Note
Though this tool is not specific for aluminum alloys, it should work just fine. However, there 
may be more optimized solutions in the catalogue!
Now that we have a general idea of what type of operation and tool we are about to use, we can finally 
launch the command that will allow us to implement this roughing operation. Since we are about 
to machine a complex 3D surface, we will need a 3D milling strategy. 3D milling operations can be 
found in the following panel:
Machining the Second Placement 254
Figure 10.5: 3D milling commands
Don’t get distracted by the large number of operations available in the list; the only two roughing 
commands are Adaptive Clearing  and Pocket Clearing . They are similar and can be used for the 
same type of geometry. The main difference between the two is hinted at by the term “adaptive. ” An 
adaptive command is always preferred over standard cutting strategies since it is capable of generating 
more advanced tool paths for a constant load on the tool.
In our case, we will click on Adaptive Clearing , and then we’ll go through each of the panel’s tabs.
Note
I won’t bother you with cutting parameters calculation anymore since we should now have the 
resources to calculate all of them by hand or using online calculators. I will only recap the most 
important ones so you can use the same parameters I picked (it is up to you to guess whether 
I used CoroPlus or if I did it all myself).

The Tool tab
After clicking Adaptive Clearing , the  first tab you will see is the To ol  tab:
Figure 10.6: The Adaptive Clearing Tool tab
These are the settings for our starting point:
• The Spindle Speed  we are going to use is 8000 rpm ; therefore, the cutting Surface Speed  is 
402 m/min
• Feed per Tooth  is 0.335 mm , resulting  in a Cutting Feedrate  of 8040 mm/min

The Geometry tab
There is not much we have  to modify in the Geometry  tab; the only option we need to look at is Rest 
Machining .

With Rest Machining  checked, our tool won’t try to machine the top face of our stock again (in fact, 
we already removed the material there with our first facing operation). Not only will this reduce wasted 
time, but the tool won’t risk rubbing against an already machined surface, shortening the tool’s life span!
The Heights tab
For the Heights  tab, you  can leave the fields untouched and just use the default values, as you can see 
in the following screenshot:
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
 257
Figure 10.8: The Adaptive Clearing Heights tab
However, I would suggest tweaking the Bottom Height  plane a little bit.
The Bottom Height  plane is our operation’s lower boundary on the z coordinate. Adding a couple of 
millimeters below the bottom plane is a safe way to ensure that all the material is removed.
For example, let’s suppose that the stock is slightly thicker than the theoretical value. In this scenario, 
the machine has no way of figuring it out; therefore, it will machine the sides of the stock up to the 
theoretical bottom of the part. In reality, the true bottom of the part is a bit below the theoretical 
bottom level; if this happens, there is the risk of finding sharp faces on the bottom of the part.
The following figure demonstrates the problem:
Figure 10.9: Bad results
Machining the Second Placement 258
As you can see, our tool moved up to the theoretical bottom of the stock, in the exact position where it 
should have ended; however, as a result, we can find very sharp and flat corners left from the operation. 
Those are most probably caused by a bad stock placement or a bigger-than-expected stock height. 
Therefore, imposing an offset to the bottom of the part is a good idea to avoid this type of issue.
The Passes tab
Next up is the Passes  tab:
Figure 10.10: The Adaptive Clearing Passes tab
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
 259
Once again, this tab  is one of the most content-dense and includes some very important settings; 
these include the following:
• Maximum Roughing Stepdown : This parameter is the maximum axial depth of cut allowed. 
As mentioned, I plan to cut the sides of the stock with a single deep shoulder milling operation. 
Our theoretical stock height is 42 mm, and to this value, we added 2 mm as the bottom offset, 
resulting in a total required height of 44 mm. Our tool can cut up to 50 mm; therefore, any 
value bigger than 44 and smaller than 50 will do the job. In the example, I set a maximum 
stepdown of 45 mm .
• Fine Stepdown : Similar to the previous parameter, this value sets the actual height of the 
steps of our pyramid. The value specified here is responsible for how rough the roughing 
operation will look once finished. Smaller values will lead to a higher machining time, but  
a faster finishing strategy and bigger values will result in a shorter roughing operation but in 
a much more demanding finishing operation. We should aim for a sweet spot, so I would try 
somewhere between 2 and 4 mm before settling on 2 mm .
• Optimal Load : This is the radial depth of cut of every cutting pass. Since we plan to machine 
the sides of our stock at high axial depths, we have to set a tiny radial depth of cut. The value 
I’m going to use is 2.34 mm .
• Direction : With this parameter, we can set the type of milling we intend to use; for our example, 
we are setting up quite a demanding cutting operation; therefore, I would definitely pick Climb  
milling for better tooth performance.
• Both Ways : Checking this option will result in a toolpath with climb milling areas and 
conventional milling areas. It is mainly intended for time-saving purposes. For our example, 
I will not check this option.
• Stock to Leave : Here, we can specify an extra layer of material all around our part. This extra 
material will be removed by the following finishing operation. For example, we may leave a  
layer around 0.5 to 1 millimeter thick.
• Order by Depth  and Order by Area : These two options optimize the generated toolpath 
reducing retracting movements. For our example, we can say that there are four distinct areas 
at the four corners of our stock. Therefore, using Order by Area , we can impose Fusion 360 
to completely machine each corner before moving to the next one. This type of behavior will 
result in a faster machining time. Order by Depth  is the default behavior, and it will machine 
layer by layer, increasing the cutting depth at each cutting pass.
• Feed Optimization : Checking this option will reduce the table feed when approaching a sharp 
corner in the toolpath; this is useful to reduce stress on the tool and avoid chattering. Our 
shape is not really sharp; however, enabling this option is always a good idea, and it doesn’t 
really affect machining time. We can leave the default values (between Maximum Directional 
Change  and Only Inner Corners ) unchanged.
• Minimum Cutting Radius : This is used to remove sharp corners on the toolpath; in our 
example, we won’t need this as we don’t have any corners to handle.Machining the Second Placement 260
• Machine Cavities : With this option unchecked, we can let Fusion 360 generate a cutting toolpath 
on just the outer faces of the part and will machine the hole in the center as well. Since I plan 
to create a dedicated operation for the hole, we can leave this unticked. It is mostly used to 
implement different operations for outer contours and closed slots.
The Linking tab
We haven’t explored the Linking  tab in  any of the previous operations we have implemented, but this 
time I just want to give you a glimpse of its usage. Inside this tab, we can find settings that are not 
really related to cutting movements, but rather, they manage the way the cutting passes are linked 
together (hence its name).
Figure 10.11: The Adaptive Clearing Linking tab
Implementing a roughing operation using adaptive clearing
 261
Most of the time, we can leave the default values; however, here, we are going to change the Stay-
Down Level  policy.
What is the Stay-Down Level  policy? During the cutting process, sometimes the tool moves without 
cutting the stock. There are many situations where this may occur, for example, when the tool is 
repositioning between cutting passes. When not cutting, the safest approach is to completely retract 
the tool upwards; this way, we can be sure that no collisions occur during the rapid movements.
Retracting the tool, however, is not instantaneous; therefore, if there are many retractions, we may 
have long periods of unproductive time during the overall machining time of the part. In order to 
reduce the time wasted on retractions we can force the tool to stay at cutting depth as long as possible 
and reduce the retraction distance.
This behavior is controlled with Stay-Down Level . If we increase the value up to Most , we get the 
fastest machining time (but it is more dangerous for the tool due to unforeseen collisions); if we leave 
the default  value set to Least , we waste a lot of time on rapid movements .
Note
Rapid movements are a particular G-code setting that forces the CNC to move in the fastest way 
possible when not cutting. Every movement where the tool is not engaging the stock should 
be set to rapid to reduce unproductive times.
In the following diagram, we can find the different toolpath generated with these two values ( Stay-
Down Least  and Stay-Down Most ):
Figure 10.12: Stay-Down Least versus Stay-Down Most
As you can see, the toolpath on the left (generated with Stay-Down Level  set to Least ) has so many 
retract movements (depicted with the yellow lines), while the toolpath on the right with Stay-Down 
Level  set to Most  has much less retraction distance.
Machining the Second Placement 262
Back to our example, since the outer geometry is open and since the stock is held in place by a custom 
fixture that keeps the part above the working bed, I don’t foresee any issues with chip evacuation 
or fixture; therefore, I’m quite confident in letting the tool stay at high depth as much as possible. 
Therefore, I’m going to set Stay-Down Level  to Most .
Changing the Stay-Down  policy greatly affects the machining time; there is a difference of 20% 
between the two examples, which for mass production is a huge value!
Also, please note that the tool is not going to rub against machined faces either since it will still retract 
by the value specified by Lift Height , in our case 0.2 mm.
Now that we have set and reviewed every parameter for the Adaptive Clearing  command, we can now 
move on to the next operation where we will machine the big hole at the center of the part.
Milling a hole
It is now time to implement a machining strategy for the big hole at the center of our part. It’s quite a 
big feature since it is a pilot hole for an M36x4 thread with a diameter of 32 mm. With such a diameter, 
it is impossible to use a drill bit; therefore, we have to create a milling operation instead.
In order to reduce tool changes, we are going to use the same tool already used for the previous operation. 
This type of tool is suitable for many different milling operations. There are multiple commands inside 
Fusion 360 to mill a hole; for example, we may go for another Adaptive Clearing  operation.
However, I want to introduce you to as many commands as possible; therefore, we are going to use a 
command that we can find in the 2D Operations  set called Bore . This command is specifically used 
for machining cylindrical or conical features and is perfect for our case:
Figure 10.13: Bore
Once launched, you’ll see a familiar panel. Like usual, let’s take this one tab at a time.
Milling a hole
 263
The Tool tab
In the To ol  tab, we have to insert  most of the cutting parameters for the operation:
Figure 10.14: The Bore Tool tab
Here are the values that we will use:
• Spindle Speed  is set at 8000 , which will lead to Surface Speed  being 402.124 m/min .
• Using the Feed per Tooth  suggested for the tool of 0.196 , we get a Cutting Feedrate  of 4704 
mm/min .
• The last value we can insert is Feed per Revolution , which can be calculated by dividing Cutting 
Feedrate  by Spindle Speed . In our  case, the result is 0.5875 .
Machining the Second Placement 264
Those are good values to use for the first attempt. However, since the hole we are about to machine is 
quite narrow and deep, we may encounter chip evacuation problems; if this is the case, we may need 
to use more conservative values.
The Geometry tab
Next up is  the Geometry  tab:
Figure 10.15: The Bore Geometry tab
There is not much we have to modify here; we simply have to select the cylinder surface using 
Circular Face Selections . This option allows us to pick any cylindrical face inside the part to be used 
for toolpath generation.
As already encountered in the drilling operation, we may let Fusion 360 automatically pick all the 
features with the same diameter by clicking Select Same Diameter  and order the machining operations 
by depths using Order by Depth . As you have already guessed, those options are useless in the example 
since we have just one single hole to machine.
The Heights panel
Moving to  the Heights  panel, we can leave most of the parameters the same, apart from one parameter 
that we should already be familiar with: Bottom Offset , which we already mentioned for Adaptive 
Clearing  and for Drilling .
Milling a hole
 265
Figure 10.16: The Bore Heights tab
Since we want to be sure to machine the entire height of the hole, it is a good idea to add a small 
Offset  from Bottom Height . In this case, I think that -3 mm  should be more than enough. This  
way, we will machine more than needed, just in case our shoulder milling of the first placement was 
slightly misplaced.
The Passes tab
We can now move  to the Passes  tab, where we set the cutting depths.
Milling a hole is quite a demanding operation, the most critical part of which is the tool plunging 
inside the stock. A common strategy to reduce the workload on the inserts is to generate a helical 
toolpath while plunging. This type of toolpath looks similar to a spring or a coil.
Machining the Second Placement 266
We can use the Passes  panel to properly define such a toolpath. To do this, we have two options, 
Angle  or Pitch :
Figure 10.17: The Bore Passes tab
As you can see, we can decide to specify the helix angle by checking Use Ramp Angle  and setting the 
Angle  value (as shown on the left screenshot), or we can set the Pitch  value (as shown on the right). 
Both methods ultimately result in the same generated toolpath.
I think it is a good idea to perform a roughing operation up to the bottom of the hole following such 
a helix. Once this roughing pass is completed, we can remove the remaining 2 mm for the final pass. 
Therefore, we shall tick the Finishing Passes  box and set a Stepover  of 2 mm .
It is now time to set the parameters for the helix; however, there are a couple of hidden problems.
The pitch of the coil is equal to the axial depth of the cut we already calculated via the equations. The 
pitch and diameter are already enough to set a helix path; therefore, most of the time, we may forget 
to check the angle of the helix, and this is a dangerous mistake!
Here comes the catch. We must be careful since every tool has a maximum angle at which it can plunge 
into a part following a helical path. For the tool we picked, the limit is 7° (you can find this value in 
the URL previously provided in the Implementing a roughing operation  section).
Therefore, we must be sure that the axial cutting depth that we specify doesn’t lead to exceeding this 
angular limit! The axial depth of cut suggested by CoroPlus is 5.25 mm, but we must check whether 
such a pitch also respects the limit of 7° on the helix angle.
Milling a hole
 267
Figure 10.18: Helix angle and pitch
As you can see in the diagram, the hole to be machined is 34 mm wide; however, we decided to leave 
2 millimeters all around for the final pass. Therefore, the hole has to be considered to be 30 mm wide.
Also, since the tool has a cutting diameter of 16 mm, we have to remove the radius from both sides 
of the hole, making the spiral boundary 14.
Given these  geometry constraints, a helix angle of 7° leads to a pitch of 1.72 mm, which is way below 
the calculated cutting depth of 5.25 mm. This means that instead of using the pitch parameter set to 
5.25 mm, we should use the angle value of 7° leading to an axial depth of cut of just 1.72 mm.
Machining the Second Placement 268
Now that we have completed every roughing operation, we can check the results with a simulation:
Figure 10.19: Simulation results
The simulation shows what we expected. Here is what we can find from the picture:
• No collisions were found
• The hole surface is green; therefore, we have no material left inside the hole, and it should be 
ready for threading
• The outer surface shows positive material due to the stock left on the shape with shoulder 
milling thick passes
Now we can finally say that we have completed the roughing of the part. There are just two more 
operations left: thread milling and profile finishing. We must change the cutting tool for both operations, 
so we can freely choose which one is to be performed first, but for this book, I would finish the outer 
area first.
Finishing the part using a morphed spiral
 269
Finishing the part using a morphed spiral
As we saw in Figure 10.5 , there are several options for finishing, some of which have many traits in 
common and are sometimes even interchangeable. The idea behind them all is to implement multiple 
cutting passes very close to each other. The smaller the distance between these cutting passes, the 
better the overall surface finish.
For our example, I think that one of the best operations we can pick is Morphed Spiral . This command 
creates an adaptive path all around the part and is capable of machining complex shapes with steep 
surfaces.
As usual, before launching the command, we have to choose the right tool to use. When finishing a 
complex 3D contour (like in our example), a ball nose end mill is one of the best possible options. 
However, this type of tool would be a bad choice for us, given our shape and our three-axis machine. 
The reason is pretty simple: our part has flat surfaces!
As you can see in the following diagram, on the left, we have a ball nose tool approaching the flat 
surface along its normal direction. This is a huge problem since, on the contact point, the cutting 
radius is zero; therefore, the cutting speed is also zero. This means that in that area, the tool won’t 
really be able to machine the stock properly.
Figure 10.20: Ball nose issues
On the right, we can see a multi-axis machine approaching the flat surface at an angle. Tilting the tool 
completely fixes the problem since the contact point is not on the rotation axis anymore; therefore, 
the cutting speed is higher than zero, resulting in an easy milling operation!
We are not machining the part on a multi-axis machine; therefore, we simply cannot use a ball nose 
tool. However, we can rely on tools whose shape is not as entirely round as a ball nose tool, such as 
a flat-end mill.
Machining the Second Placement 270
The tool I decided to go for is somewhere in the middle: RA215.26-4050HAL45L 1620.  It is a flat-
end mill with a cutting diameter of 15.875 mm and quite a large corner radius since it is 3.175 mm.
Y ou can find more details at the following link: https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/
en-us/products/pages/productdetails.aspx?c=RA215.26-4050HAL45L%20
1620&unitsystem=Metric .
Now that we have picked our tool, we can finally launch the Morphed Spiral  command and work 
our way through the tabs.
The Tool tab
First up is the To ol  tab:
Figure 10.21: The Morphed Spiral Tool tab
Finishing the part using a morphed spiral
 271
The Spindle Speed  we are going to use is 7138.16 rpm , which leads to the Surface Speed  being 356 
m/min . Feed per Tooth  is 0.226 mm ; therefore, the Cutting Feedrate  is 9679.35 mm/min .
As you can see, these values are very high, particularly if we compare them to previous operations. 
However, we don’t have to be too scared since the tool is not going to remove much material during 
the process; there is only a thin layer of material to get rid of. Furthermore, using such a fast set of 
parameters is actually desired since we have to reduce any rubbing against the already machined surfaces.
Anyhow, please keep in mind that this is our first approach to the part; if, when machining the first 
component, we find that the values are too extreme, we can always reduce them (hopefully before 
damaging the part or the tool).
The Geometry tab
The Geometry  tab is pretty straightforward, but there is something we have to set. There is a typical 
problem, in fact; we have to specify which faces have to be considered for the operation. By default, 
Fusion 360 will try to machine every face with a layer of material yet to be removed. In our case, however, 
we just want to machine the outer area of the part and leave the central hole for the next operations.
Therefore, a typical fix is to create a surface cap to block the tool:
Figure 10.22: Surface cap to prevent unwanted machining
Machining the Second Placement 272
As you can see from the screenshot, I created a surface (using the DESIGN  environment of Fusion 
360) to cover the center of the part. This way, using the Avoid/Touch Surfaces  option, I can be sure 
that the tool is not going to machine the center. This is a typical dirty  way of fixing a toolpath that is 
too intrusive!
Other than that, you can leave the default parameters.
The Heights panel
The Heights  panel has no  hidden troubles to overcome. This time we can use the default settings, but 
we should increase the Bottom Height  Offset  a bit:
Figure 10.23: The Morphed Spiral Heights tab
Adding an offset to the bottom of the model is always a good idea (as long as we don’t collide with 
the holding fixture) since we want to be sure that we remove the entirety of the material left from 
previous operations. Here, we will set the Offset  to -5 mm .
Finishing the part using a morphed spiral
 273
The Passes tab
There are a few interesting parameters to note in the Passes  tab, which we will look at here:
Figure 10.24: The Morphed Spiral Passes tab
Since the Morphed Spiral  command  creates a complex 3D path spiraling above the part, we can 
decide how to manage the generated toolpath; we have a few options to control it:
• Inside/Outside Direction : This controls whether the tool machines from the center outward 
or vice versa. Usually, the best idea is to leave the Shortest machining distance  default setting, 
which should result in the fastest machining time.
• Clockwise : This is an option that will generate a toolpath following a clockwise or a counterclockwise 
direction of movement. Be careful: choosing one or the other may lead to larger areas machined 
in conventional milling rather than climb milling (it mostly depends on the geometry).
Machining the Second Placement 274
• Stepover  and Cusp Height : These are strictly connected, so changing one will affect the other. 
Stepover  measures how close the different cutting passes will be generated, while Cusp Height  
is the resulting roughness of the surface ( 𝑅𝑅𝑧𝑧 ).
Note
There are several distinct ways to measure the roughness of a part. Roughness, 𝑅𝑅𝑧𝑧 , is expressed in 
microns as the distance between the highest peak on the machined surface and the deepest valley. 
Y ou can read more about roughness values at the following link: https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Surface_roughness .
If we look back at the diagram of the part in Figure 8.1 , we can find that on the outer faces, a roughness 
of 12.9 microns is required; however, the type of roughness to be used was not specified. We will 
suppose it is expressed as roughness, 𝑅𝑅𝑧𝑧 , since it is quite easy to set with this finishing command. 
In Cusp Height , we simply type the roughness value converted in millimeters; therefore, we enter a 
value of 0.0129 mm .
An important parameter that you may have already noticed is the Up/Down Milling  parameter, which 
this time is not set to Climb  milling only, but set to Both . Before screaming that this is a huge mistake 
since we said that climb milling is always preferred whenever possible, let me explain my decision.
Finishing operations can be quite time-consuming since there are hundreds of cutting passes. Choosing 
to perform all these passes in climb milling only may increase the overall production time quite a lot; 
therefore, for this example, since the target surface roughness is not very tight, I decided to try to use 
both conventional and climb milling.
In Figure 10.25 , on the left, we have the toolpath generated using only climb milling, while on the 
right, we have the toolpath generated with both climb milling and conventional milling:
Figure 10.25: Climb milling versus climb milling and conventional milling
Thread milling
 275
As we can spot at first glance, the toolpath generated on the right has almost no travel movements 
compared to the example on the left. Also, the overall machining time is reduced by almost 30%, which 
is quite a big deal indeed; therefore, I think a less-than-optimal milling approach is worth a try at least!
Now that we have set everything needed for the operation, we can have a look at the simulation results:
Figure 10.26: Morphed spiral simulation
So far, so good! The part looks amazing, with no extra material left on the surfaces, and the simulation 
found no collisions!
We can now move to the final operation, which is thread milling. It will be our last milling example 
and also, be aware, one of the most complex.
Thread milling
The last operation we have left to complete the part is threading the central hole with an M36x4 profile.
During the previous operation (in the Milling a hole  section), we already machined the pilot hole, 
which has a diameter of 31.97 mm.
We should also already know the theory behind threads since we already covered a similar operation 
in Chapter 5 ; however, this time we’ll cover the process in a bit more detail and try to explain a few 
potential issues we didn’t mention before.
Machining the Second Placement 276
Thread geometry
In order to machine threads, we  have to know them! To find all the information needed for our thread, 
we can discover ISO thread tables online.
When searching the web for thread tables, we have to make sure that we are looking at the right type 
of thread. Internal and external threads have different dimensions, and confusing one for the other 
will result in a wrong thread profile.
In the following table, we can find the data for an M36x4 internal thread; we will need these values 
for the calculations ahead:
Size Pitch Pitch Diameter Major Diameter Minor Diameter
M36x4 4 33.402 36 31.670
Figure 10.27: M36x4 internal thread specs
Please note that when looking at online threads tables, you may find that real tables are a bit more 
complex than the one provided here. In reality, on good-quality tables, there is always a certain tolerance 
on acceptable diameter dimensions; this will result in finding the maximum and the minimum value 
that every parameter can assume. Since this book is about CAM and not about milling threads, we 
will oversimplify this part, ignoring machining tolerances.
Before jumping to tool selection, we have to spend a couple of words on how thread milling is set 
using Fusion 360. The key idea is that after selecting the hole cylinder, we have to specify how much 
the tool should plunge into the part to machine the thread:
Figure 10.28: Good versus bad thread milling
Thread milling
 277
As we can see from the diagram, it is important to have a proper thread that is up to the correct 
specifications; even minor errors in the thread geometry will result in a non-working part.
Long story short, we have to calculate how much the cutting tooth should extend beyond the limit 
of the minor diameter. To do this, we need to refer to the thread drawing already used for turning:
Figure 10.29: ISO thread specs
Here we can see several dimensions using letters such as 𝑃𝑃  and 𝐻𝐻 . 𝑃𝑃  is, of course, the pitch, which 
in our case is 4, while 𝐻𝐻  is the theoretical thread height, which can be calculated using the following 
formula:
As we can see  from the diagram, the thread height for an internal thread can be expressed in two ways:
• The first formula uses 𝐻𝐻  as its main parameters:
• While the second formula is simpler if we already know all the thread specifications (which 
we do):
𝐻𝐻=√3
2∗𝑃𝑃=√3
2∗4 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 =3.464  𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 
5
8𝐻𝐻=5
8∗3.464  𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 =2.165 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 
𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
2=36−31.67
2=2.165𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 Machining the Second Placement 278
This may sound like we solved the problem of finding the radial depth of cut for our cutting tool, but 
there are two critical points we need to pay attention to.
First of all, this value is the thread height for an internal thread, and it is measured from the minor 
diameter of the thread; as we can see in the thread dimensions table, an M36 is equal to 31.67 mm.
The problem is that the cylindrical face at the center of the part has the diameter of the pilot hole, 
which is 31.97 mm and is bigger than the minor diameter of the thread. Therefore, if we want to 
work precisely, we need to create an additional surface at the center of the cylinder corresponding to 
the minor diameter. Such a surface will then have to be selected as geometry for the thread milling 
command instead of the pilot hole.
Secondly, we have to  keep in mind the tool shape and how its tip is modeled inside Fusion 360:
Figure 10.30: Tip offset
As we can see from the diagram, there are three tools: tool #1 and #2 have a sharp tip, while tool #3 
has a flat end. The origin of tools #1 and #3 is placed on the tip itself while the origin of tool #2 has 
a backward offset.
Thread milling
 279
Since every tool plunges inside the stock by the same value ( 2.165 mm  for our example), and since 
this distance is measured from the tool origin, tool #1 will machine a shallow thread; hence, it will 
require a correction factor (or offset) equal to H/8, which for the example is 0.433 mm . Tools #2 and 
#3 will machine the thread properly since their origin is properly placed.
Don’t be too scared of what we just discovered; it was simply to remark that we should always be 
careful with tool origin placement, especially with custom tools!
Picking the proper threading tool
Now that we have a clear idea of thread milling, we can move to tool selection and parameters. I 
decided to use the following cutting insert named 327R12-22 250VM-THM 1025 . Y ou can find 
more information at the following link: https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/
products/pages/productdetails.aspx?c=327R12-22%20250VM-THM%201025 .
Let’s analyze the most important details of this type of tool to see whether it is the right tool for our 
job. First of all, we have to understand whether this tool is capable of milling a thread with the pitch 
we need.
The online datasheet shows that the tool can machine between 5 and 10 threads per inch  (TPI). 
Converting threads per inch to threads per millimeter gives us a working range from 0.19 to 0.39 
threads per millimeter (we just have to divide the TPI value by 25.4).
Now that we have the number of threads per millimeter, we need to find the pitch:
Inserting the values inside the formula, we get the following results:
This tool can machine thread pitches in a range between 5.08 mm and 2.54 mm. Our thread has  
a pitch of 4 mm, so this is the right tool.
Let's calculate the theoretical thread height we need. The minor diameter of the thread is equal to 
31.67mm, while the pilot hole is 31.97mm; therefore, their difference is 0.3mm, meaning there is 0.15mm 
on each side of the pilot hole. To this value we shall add our thread height, which is 2.598mm (6/8H).
Long story short, we need a tool with a theoretical thread height of at least 2.748mm. Therefore, the 
tool used in the example shall work properly for us.𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ℎ[𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ]= 1

Implementing thread milling in Fusion 360
We can now launch the Thread  command, which we can find inside the 2D milling commands 
dropdown:
Figure 10.31: The Thread milling command
Let’s take a look at the tabs.
The Tool tab
From the tool datasheet, we don’t find any suggested parameters for aluminum alloys; therefore, we have 
to pick the parameters for steel. Those parameters will probably be quite conservative for aluminum 
milling; therefore, we may decide to increase them to maximize production later. As an alternative, 
we can always calculate the parameters ourselves!
Thread milling
 281
Figure 10.32: The Thread milling Tool tab
For our  example, we will set Surface Speed  to 200 m/min , which leads to a Spindle Speed  of 2933.73 
rpm , and a Feed per Tooth  of 0.04 mm , which leads to a Cutting Feedrate  of 704.096 mm/min .
Machining the Second Placement 282
The Geometry tab
Inside the Geometry  tab, there  is not much we have to do:
Figure 10.33: The Thread milling Geometry tab
Here, we simply have to select the cylindrical surface. Please note that, as already mentioned, we don’t 
have to select the pilot hole (which has a diameter of 31.97 mm).
I think the simplest approach for a beginner is to design and select a surface whose diameter corresponds 
to the minor diameter for our thread.
In our case, an M36 internal thread has a minor diameter of 31.67 mm.
Thread milling
 283
The Heights tab
We can now move to the next  panel, which is called Heights :
Figure 10.34: The Thread milling Heights tab
This window is no surprise for us either; much like we did for many other operations, we just want 
to add a bit of offset on the bottom of the thread to be sure to perfectly machine the entire length of 
the hole. For this example, we will simply add around -5 mm .
Machining the Second Placement 284
The Passes tab
The Passes  tab, as usual, is a bit trickier:
Figure 10.35: The Thread milling Passes tab
As you can see, there  are several options already discussed time and time again, but others are new 
and a bit confusing. In the following list, we will review the new options available:
• Start Angle Reference : This parameter, combined with Start Angle , allows us to specify the 
angle at which the thread shall begin. Most of the time you don’t need to specify this value 
since almost no one cares about thread angle.
• Threading Hand : With this option, we can specify whether to create a Right handed  thread 
or a Left handed  thread. Since this is thread milling and not tapping, we don’t have to change 
the tool, as the threading mill can machine both right-handed and left-handed threads.
• Thread Pitch : This describes how much a thread is screwed in and out of a threaded hole in 
one revolution. In our case, the pitch is 4 mm .
Thread milling
 285
• Pitch Diameter Offset : This is the most difficult parameter to understand; basically, it is how 
much the cutting insert plunges inside the stock when machining the thread. It is measured 
from the selected cylindrical surface to the tool origin. In our case, we can calculate the thread 
height as 5/8H, which is equal to 2.165 mm. Alternatively, if you recall from the Thread geometry  
section, we can calculate the same value with the following formula:
Since the tool we are using has the origin on the sharp tip, I shall add an extra 1/8H for a total 
of 2.598 mm. In addition, this value is related to the diameter, so we have to multiply the value 
by two, resulting in a value of 5.19614 mm .
• Do Multiple Threads : This is a typical parameter for high-pitch lead screws; this is not the 
case for us, of course.
Now that we have completed this operation, we have reached the finish line; the part is now completed, 
and we can admire the result!

Summary
Congratulations, we have now finished the section on milling! I’m sure that we had a good time 
together creating our machining strategies from scratch.
In this chapter, we faced several advanced milling strategies: we used one of the best milling operations 
that Fusion 360 has to offer, which is Adaptive Clearing , then we found out why it is important to 
find a sweet spot between roughing passes and finishing passes, and how tweaking retract movements 
or milling direction can increase productivity.
After that, we took quite a deep dive into thread milling, where we tried to uncover every possible 
parameter needed for proper machining and we found out how to check whether the selected tool 
was up to the task.
This was probably the most difficult chapter to understand due to the geometries and the challenges 
proposed; however, I promise you that the hardest part is now over.
It is now time to leave milling behind and finally move on to a new manufacturing technology. In the 
next chapter, we are about to discover laser cutting!Part 3 –  
Laser Cutting Using  
Fusion 360
In this part, we will discover the basic concepts behind laser cutting, a fascinating technology with so 
much potential. Not only will we discover how a laser cutting process is managed via CAM, but we 
will also take a deep dive into nesting and its value for cost optimizations. Ultimately, we will create 
a cutting toolpath ready to be exported to our laser cutting machine.
This part includes the following chapters:
• Chapter 11 , Getting Started with Laser Cutting
• Chapter 12 , Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting
• Chapter 13 , Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation11
Getting Started with  
Laser Cutting
In this chapter, we are going to introduce laser cutting, including its strengths and drawbacks and 
the potential it can give you.
Fusion 360 has quite a limited set of commands and tools dedicated to laser cutting and is not exactly 
the best solution when it comes to laser cutting. However, getting a general idea of a new technology 
is still very important since it will help us to expand our knowledge beyond milling and turning.
Therefore, the goal of this chapter (and the following ones on laser cutting) is to provide several 
hints about laser cutting. These chapters are not really aimed at industrial production. We will take 
a discursive approach to the subject, so we won’t be diving too much into parameters or equations.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Introducing lasers
• How does a laser cut?
• Reviewing the pros and cons of laser cutting
Technical requirements
We have now changed the production technology, moving from milling to laser cutting; therefore, 
this chapter is a fresh restart – there are no prior requirements.
Introducing lasers
Lasers, known to humankind  since the ancient Egyptians, proved themselves to be valuable time 
and time again during the construction of the pyramids – at least this is something a ufologist may 
suggest to us.Getting Started with Laser Cutting 290
Jokes aside, in reality, lasers date back to 1916 when Albert Einstein first theorized their behavior. As 
you may expect from such an important physicist, grasping the fundamental nature of lasers is rather 
complex and would require us to be quantum physicists. That kind of understanding is outside the 
scope of this book, so instead, we will simplify things quite a bit.
Long story short, a laser is an energetic beam  of light that is coherent and focused on a very tiny spot.  
I know that this may sound weird to most, but light is far more complex than most of us would imagine.
Light is an electromagnetic  (EM) wave that we can see with our eyes. Saying  that, not every EM 
wave is visible to the eye; it mostly depends on its wavelength, which is a property of every EM wave.
In the following  diagram, we can see a large chunk of the electromagnetic spectrum  ranging from  
1 picometer (1 pm is equal to 0,000000000001 meters) on the left up to 1 meter on the right. Then, 
we can find vertical lines that divide the spectrum into subcategories of EM waves:
Figure 11.1: EM spectrum
Taking a couple  of examples, here we can  see that waves with a wavelength over 1m are Radio Waves , 
and waves between 1m and 1mm  are Microwaves .
As you may have also noticed, inside the visible range of the EM spectrum, different colors are 
associated with different wavelengths. For example, light rays with a wavelength of 740 nanometers  
(nm) are seen as red, while light rays with a wavelength of 380 nm are violet.
How does a laser cut?
 291
Furthermore, EM radiations with wavelengths bigger than 740 nm or smaller than 380 nm are not 
visible to our eyes. For example, we cannot see X-rays or radio waves because their wavelength is 
beyond the limit of our eyes, but of course, they are real nonetheless.
This prelude on wavelengths is needed to highlight a very basic concept: despite what we may have 
learned from Hollywood movies, lasers may be both invisible and deadly!
Included in Figure 11.1  are two dots on the infrared  (IR) range, which mark the two  most common 
types  of cutting laser  wavelengths for the manufacturing industry: CO2  lasers and Fiber  lasers. Both 
of these lasers are completely invisible to our eyes and yet can instantly destroy our retina.
Note
Always wear protective goggles when working with lasers and read the safety instructions when 
operating close to a laser machine.
Something else to note is that not every type of laser can cut every material. It mostly depends on 
the behavior of the material we need to cut, how it reacts to the light beam, and how much of the 
incoming radiation is absorbed, refracted, or reflected.
For example, a CO2 laser can cut cardboard  and wood effortlessly, while a fiber laser cannot. On the 
other hand, a fiber laser can cut very shiny materials such as copper and aluminum much better than 
a CO2 laser can. Choosing one type of laser over another mostly depends on your needs.
In this book, we will focus on sheet metal cutting from the point of view of welded steel components. 
For this type of manufacturing, fiber lasers are absolutely the leading technology; therefore, we won’t 
deal with other types of lasers anymore.
Before we do any laser cutting, in the next section, we will find out how a beam of light can cut a 
solid, tough chunk of metal!
How does a laser cut?
In recent years, the power of fiber laser sources has exploded, and every year, new records are achieved. 
A few years ago, a laser source with a power of 6 kilowatts  (KW) would have been a dream come true 
for most producers; however, nowadays, it is typical to find cutting machines with a 15 KW source, 
with some producers even starting to experiment with sources up to 50 KW .
To wrap our head around these numbers, let’s imagine my motorbike, which has a power of 50 KW; 
at full throttle, it can bring its mass (190 Kg) and my mass (75 Kg) all the way up to more than 200 
km/h. Now, imagine all that power focused on a tiny spot with an area of less than a square millimeter. 
As you may guess, focusing all this energy on such a small surface leads to temperatures high enough 
for the metal to melt (or vaporize).Getting Started with Laser Cutting 292
Melting the metal, however, is not enough to cut it properly: we need to remove the melted metal and 
clean the cut width; otherwise, once the laser moves, the melted part will solidify again!
In the following diagram, we get an idea of how a laser-cutting machine works:
Figure 11.2: Laser cutting
As we can see, the metal sheet ( 1) is laid on the bed of teeth ( 2), and the laser nozzle ( 3) is very close 
to the surface it is cutting. In the area where the laser beam is focused ( 4), the metal reaches very high 
temperatures and melts down. All the melted droplets are evacuated from the bottom ( 5) thanks to 
high-pressure gases that clean the cutting area. The nature of such gases can vary according to the 
material being cut, but the most common gases used are oxygen  (O2) and nitrogen  (N2).
Is this all we need to know to set up a cutting process? Of course not; there is the shape of the laser 
nozzle to choose from, the type of gas, the power and pulses of the laser to set, and so on. There are 
lots of variables in laser cutting, but luckily, we don’t really have to understand or calculate them all.
Almost every professional laser cutting machine has its own CAM software and a material database 
already tweaked for the best performance with that particular machine. This way, we can simply 
input the material type, thickness, and 2D profile of the material that we want to cut and let the post-
processor manage the cutting parameters.
There are several software suites specific to laser cutting, one of the most famous solutions  being 
Lantek (which you can find more about here: www.lantek.com ).
Fusion 360 is a bit different – it is not focused on a single specific task such as laser cutting; rather, 
it is intended as a general software suite to bring our projects from concept to production. For this 
reason, sometimes it is not as complete as other alternatives.
Reviewing the pros and cons of laser cutting
 293
Therefore, currently, there is not a great number  of laser operators that use Fusion 360 for laser cutting 
since there are far better solutions!
Note
As we are about to discover, most of the parts cut with laser machines consist of 2D profiles; 
therefore, the most common file type used for laser cutting is .dxf . For this reason, it is not 
rare to find designers still using 2D software such as AutoCAD, CorelDraw, or even Inkscape.
Now that we have an idea of the cutting process, we can move on to discover the main features of 
laser cutting.
Reviewing the pros and cons of laser cutting
Cutting metal sheets with  a laser is a valuable option for a wide range of applications, from rough 
welded parts for building sites to artistic decorations that can be found in finely furnished homes. 
However, as you may expect, no manufacturing technology is free of limitations or drawbacks.
Let’s review the pros and cons of this process.
Advantages of laser cutting
Let’s start by discussing why laser cutting is such a great technology.
Extreme productivity
In other technologies (such as milling or turning, for example), the tool  powerfully plunges into the 
stock to remove the chip. This type of strong interaction with the part needs a very stiff CNC structure 
that doesn’t bend too much and a strong stock holding fixture to counteract such a force.
As we found out, laser cutting is achieved without touching the part with any component of our machine. 
This means that as long as the laser source can generate enough power to melt the material, we can 
cut at practically whatever speed we see fit, achieving impressive speeds and accelerations that would 
be impossible for any milling CNC center. Nowadays, there are several laser machines that move up 
to 300 m/min with accelerations of 2-3 g, numbers impossible for any other manufacturing process.
Note
Acceleration  is a value that expresses how fast the speed  is changing. It is measured in meters 
over seconds squared  (m/s2). A very common practice is to express  acceleration as a factor of 
g (which is the earth’s gravity acceleration and has a value of 9.81 m/s2).
Therefore an acceleration of 3 g equals a value of 29.43 m/s2.Getting Started with Laser Cutting 294
No chip formation and waste friendly
It may sound obvious, but laser cutting creates no chip! Since the width of the laser cut is very small, 
around 0.2–0.3 mm, for all practical purposes, we can consider that no material is actually removed. 
The only wasted  material is due to the areas not being optimized on the sheet nesting .
Nesting is a procedure  aimed at optimizing the placement of parts onto a metal sheet. In the following 
screenshot, we can get a clearer idea of what nesting is all about:
Figure 11.3: Nesting
As we can see on the left, we have quite a conservative nesting with a lot of material not used for the 
parts, while on the right, there is a tightly packed nesting pattern that will lead to low amounts of 
wasted material.
We will explore nesting in more detail in Chapter 12 .
Highly flexible
Laser-cutting machines can cut a whole range of materials and thicknesses.
Until a few years ago, a laser could cut only thin metal sheets, and the only option for thicker plates 
was another cutting process called plasma cutting.
Today, thanks to powerful fiber sources, laser cutting can easily cut very thick chunks of metal, gradually 
overtaking plasma cutting (and it is not hard to imagine that it will replace it entirely sooner or later).
Not only has the expansion  of fiber technology drastically increased cutting powers but it has also 
reduced the costs of production and maintenance, meaning nowadays, several companies offer their 
laser machines at compelling costs.
Drawbacks of laser cutting
It is now time to jump into the drawbacks  of laser technology, though several points may be unappealing 
to you.
Reviewing the pros and cons of laser cutting
 295
Heat generation
Since lasers cut the material by melting or vaporizing the spot where they are pointed, this heat may 
alter the metal’s crystalline structure.
To put things simply, if you have ever seen a sword maker creating a sword, you may have noticed 
that once the sword is very  hot and red, it is rapidly submerged in a barrel of cold water. This process 
is called quenching .
The fast cooling of the metal forces its internal molecules to arrange in a lattice that enhances the 
mechanical properties of the sword, which becomes stiff and hard but also quite fragile. A later 
controlled heating of the sword will give the blade its ultimate properties, a sweet point between 
stiffness and toughness.
With laser cutting, uncontrolled heat generation and cooling is a problem that may introduce weak 
spots or distortions on the part; however, a proper material database and the right management of 
cutting parameters can greatly mitigate this scenario.
Calamine
Another problem related to heat occurs when cutting certain types of steel alloys (using O2 as cutting 
gas). In this scenario, the cut  surface gets covered in a dark layer of calamine . Calamine is an oxide 
created as a subproduct of the highly exothermic  reaction between oxygen  and steel.
Note
An exothermic reaction  is a chemical reaction that generates a large amount of heat.
Other than looking bad, this layer of calamine  is not tightly bound to the steel and can be peeled off  
very easily. Painting (or welding) on a very thin and fragile layer of material is not a great idea as the 
final result would be compromised: the paint would fall off immediately, and the surface would rust 
in no time!
This layer of unwanted material  has to be removed mechanically, using abrasives, or chemically via 
pickling. Luckily these are easy solutions, though still inconvenient overall.
Sharp edges and surface finish
Laser cutting tends to create sharp edges on the cut area, so handling thin metal sheets without gloves 
will probably end with a wound on our hands. This is also true for thicker materials. In general, as a 
rule of thumb, the thicker the material, the worse the surface finish will be:Getting Started with Laser Cutting 296
Figure 11.4: Sharp edges
The image shows a 30 mm plate of aluminum cut with a high-power laser beam. As we can see at 
the top of the picture, the laser nozzle was closer to the surface, so the finish is quite smooth and 
homogeneous. But moving toward the bottom of the plate, the roughness gets higher and higher, 
giving it a distinct, sharp, saw-like profile.
Only works with 2D profiles
This may be quite obvious to some, but laser cutting doesn’t let us cut 3D shapes. Laser cutting is like 
having a blank sheet of paper and a pair of scissors: we cannot cut at variable depths, and we cannot 
cut using multiple placements. This is true for 99.99% of the laser machines out there.
However, what about the other 0.01%? There are some rare models of laser machines capable of tilting 
the head for four- or five-axis cutting. However, don't get too excited, as this option is mostly used to 
create chamfers for welding or tube cutting.
As a rule of thumb, we just have to remember that the shape complexity and accuracy obtainable with 
laser cutting is way lower than milling.
Overall, laser cutting  is an interesting technology with extreme productivity and excellent value for 
money, but with some limitations we should always consider. Saying that, it’s a good tool to have in 
our hands.
Summary
And that’s the end of the chapter. Here, we introduced lasers, looked at how a laser machine works, 
and started to understand the underlying complexities and considerations that proper CAM software 
manages to cut parts with a laser.
Despite not being able to call ourselves experts on the subject after these few pages, I hope that we 
now have a general idea of what is going on with laser cutting and when it may be an interesting 
manufacturing solution to opt for.
In the next chapter, we will continue our laser-cutting introduction by exploring how to create  
a proper nesting for our parts!
12
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting
This chapter will cover the topic of nesting optimization as deeply as possible without resulting in 
being too difficult for a novice.
As we are about to discover, learning how to manage nesting for a cutting process is essential to reduce 
production time and costs. Proper production optimization for large batches is quite a complex topic 
to cover since it consists of manufacturing processes highly intertwined with logistics and warehouse 
management. Therefore, we must simplify the subject and will focus on the manufacturing point of 
view only.
The goal of this chapter is to introduce all the tools that Fusion 360 offers for a proper nesting setup 
and the other options available. In addition to the basic software included in Fusion 360, we are also 
about to explore a valuable extension (called Nesting and Fabrication) with several additional features.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Presenting the example model
• Understanding nesting optimization
• Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
Technical requirements
To be able to properly follow this chapter, make sure that you have read Chapter 11 .
The only special requirement to follow this chapter is to have a working license for the Nesting and

However, this plugin is not mandatory since the key concepts and ideas are still valuable even without 
such an expansion.
Presenting the example model
As simple as it may sound, in order to create a nesting study, we should first start with a kit of parts 
to be nested. We will work with a welded structure that I created for that purpose:
Figure 12.1: Example part
As we can see from the diagram, it is a rather complex part with several different components. It is 
composed of 3 mm mild steel sheets, which are assembled and welded together.
There are a total of five different parts in the assembly that are repeated multiple times:
Figure 12.2: Example part instances
Understanding nesting optimization
 299
To create  a kit of parts for the welded structure, we need to cut five different components in different 
quantities. The larger part has to be cut twice, and the smaller one has to be cut eight times, and so on.
Now that we have a clear understanding of the example part and its internal components, we need 
to start thinking about nesting optimization. As we discovered in Chapter 11 , optimizing nesting is 
the best way to reduce production time and waste material. In the next section, we will study this 
important process.
Understanding nesting optimization
Nesting is all  about placing as many parts as possible on the stock metal sheet we are about to cut. It’s 
a bit like aiming for a Tetris record where the shape of the brick has to conform to all the others to 
pack everything as close as possible.
However, we don’t really have to manually orient the components on the boundaries of the stock metal 
sheet, as there are now automatic processes that optimize part placements in just one click.
Saying that, there are two important factors to consider that are strictly interconnected with nesting: 
sheet format and batch volume. Let’s look at those now.
Sheet format
Sheet format  is the easiest variable to optimize – we simply need to consider  the size of the metal 
sheet we want to cut.
As we all know, paper sheets are sold in standard formats such as A4 and A3 and so on. Metal sheets 
work the same way; there are several standard formats, some bigger and some smaller. From an 
industrial point of view, most professional laser machines have a format of 3000x1500 millimeters. 
However, we can also pick any smaller sheet size; as long as the raw metal sheet is bigger than the 
bigger part we need to cut, we are good to go.
For our example, we have a smaller machine capable of handling panels with a maximum dimension 
of 1000x500 millimeters, and this will be our format. Given these dimensions, we may start playing 
Tetris and optimize the placement of the parts in such a format, like so:Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 300
Figure 12.3: Nesting example #1
As you can see, even the best Tetris player won’t be able to put every part of our welded structure 
onto a single metal sheet; however, as we have done, we can create one set of parts (one kit) using 
two metal sheets.
So, the problem is solved: the minimum number of metal sheets we will use to create our part is two. 
If we need two welded assemblies, we have to cut four metal sheets, if we need to produce three, we 
have to cut six sheets, and so on.
But not so fast; there’s a catch.
Most of the time, a production order is not for a single welded assembly, probably  we have to produce 
more than one; for example, we may have to produce 10 of them or 100. Therefore, instead of thinking 
in terms of a single kit of parts needed to produce a single welded assembly, we have to start optimizing 
the entire production lot (also called batch volume).
Batch volume
Optimizing nesting for the production of a single kit of parts for our welded structure is, for sure, a 
really flexible solution, but it may not be fully optimized for large batches.
As you may have gathered yourself from Figure 12.3 , there is quite a large area of the sheet not used 
– if we keep using the same nesting even for larger production batches, that area will always result 
in material waste.
Understanding nesting optimization
 301
A much better solution is to create nesting that is optimized for the production batch; this way, the 
placement will have much more room to play with. Fusion 360, instead of trying to fit all the parts 
contained in a single kit in the least amount of sheets, will try to fit all the parts for all the kits in the 
least amount of sheets. It is a subtle difference that makes a huge optimization improvement!
Let’s suppose we actually need to produce three kits of parts to assemble three welded structures:
Figure 12.4: Nesting example #2
As we can see here, the overall number of needed sheets is reduced: optimizing a nesting for a bigger 
batch assures an overall smaller number of metal sheets used.
This time, in order to produce three kits to weld, we only needed five metal sheets, compared to the 
previous nesting example (displayed in Figure 12.3 ), which needed six sheets! Not only does this 
improvement mean less scrap material, but it also means we get higher productivity since we repeat 
the loading and unloading process fewer times.
For smaller batches, such a gain is negligible, but once the batch is in the hundreds, the advantages 
are clear. The only drawback to batch-optimized nesting is that if, for any reason, the batch number 
changes, we may need to create another nesting from scratch.
Now that we have a good idea of how to create a proper nesting, let’s find out how to create it with 
Fusion 360.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 302
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
There are three different approaches for  creating a nesting in Fusion 360, each with different potential:
• Manual placement
• The Arrange command
• The Nesting and Fabrication extension
Let’s review them now. Please keep in mind that the most complete toolset for nesting is not always the 
best way to go; if we have to manage simple productions, we may want to opt for a simpler solution.
Manual placement
This is probably the simplest yet most flexible way to go. We simply have to manually orient the 
parts onto a certain area using the Move  tool in Fusion 360, much like we do inside the DESIGN  
environment for any assembly.
As simple as it sounds, this approach lets us position the parts exactly as we see them fit; however, it 
is the longest approach, and it doesn’t allow great optimization.
The Arrange command
A more advanced  approach is to use a dedicated command called Arrange .
Y ou can find this command inside the following drop-down menu:Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 303
Figure 12.5: The Arrange command
If you cannot find the command or if it is grayed out inside the drop-down menu, you probably have 
to enable it inside the options of Fusion 360.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 304
To enable this  command, we must go inside Fusion 360’s Preferences , then the Design  panel, and 
click the Enable Arrange and Simplify tools  option:
Figure 12.6: Enabling the Arrange command
Then restart Fusion 360 to make sure the Arrange  command is available.
A quick refresh of components
The Arrange  command is capable of arranging the components of our assembly onto a flat surface. 
Be careful: the word component  is essential here, trying to use the Arrange  command with bodies  
won’t work at all.
Before reviewing how to create a nesting using the Arrange  command, I think it is important to 
remind ourselves of the difference between components and bodies.
Fusion 360 has three main types of elements inside the geometry hierarchy: bodies , components,  and 
assemblies . Since this book is not about the DESIGN  environment of Fusion 360, we won’t dig too 
much into the differences between these elements, but let’s just say that bodies are basic geometries 
such as solids and surfaces, components are groups of one or more bodies and are physical objects, 
and assemblies are groups of components or sub-assemblies.
To refresh your mind, here is a typical structure for any Fusion 360 file:
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 305
Figure 12.7: The assembly structure
As we can see, there is an assembly called Assembly v1  that contains two components called 
COMPONENT_1:1  and COMPONENT_2:1 .
Inside COMPONENT_1:1 , we have a single solid body, while inside COMPONENT_2:1 , we can 
find a surface body and a solid body.
Sometimes we may have forgotten about this difference and created a large group of bodies that should 
be components instead. This is not an issue, as we can convert them to components by right-clicking 
on the body and selecting Create Components from Bodies :
Figure 12.8: Create Components from Bodies
Note
Please be careful; at the time of writing, sheet metal bodies cannot be converted to components!
This concludes the digression into Fusion 360 geometry hierarchy.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 306
Using the Arrange command
Now that we know the difference between bodies and components, we can keep going with the 
Arrange  command. Let’s launch it using Figure 12.5  as a reference. Y ou will then see the panel shown 
in Figure 12.9 :
 
Figure 12.9: The Arrange panel
The panel for this command is quite limited, but let’s take a better look at it:
• Objects : This selection tool lets us specify the objects we want to arrange.
• Plane/Sketch/Face : This selection tool lets us specify the geometry to use as a plane reference. 
The components to be nested will be oriented on this plane.
• Length/Width : With these values, we can set the maximum dimensions of the nesting result.
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 307
• Frame Width : With this value, we can set a constant offset from the outer contour of our 
metal sheet. This option is very useful to compensate for minor imperfections in the metal 
sheet position and rotation.
• Object Spacing : This is the  minimum distance to be set between nested parts.
Though the Arrange  command is somewhat useful, there is a much better way to create nested parts 
inside Fusion 360.
The Nesting and Fabrication extension
The default version of Fusion 360 is a bit limited when it comes to nesting, but there is quite a good 
extension focused on nesting and fabrication that we can purchase to expand the nesting capabilities.
This extension, called Nesting and Fabrication , is intended to be professionally oriented, therefore 
it doesn’t come with a hobbyist license. However, if you are interested, you can start a seven-day 
trial using the following link: https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/
nesting-fabrication-extension?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription .
Note
Such an extension is not mandatory for laser cutting; it is simply aimed at increasing nesting 
capabilities. If you don’t plan to learn this extension, you can jump directly to the next chapter.
Now that the extension has been enabled, we can find all the commands related to nesting inside the 
FABRICATION  tab:
Figure 12.10: The Fabrication tab
If your panel doesn’t look like mine, chances are high that the plugin was not properly installed or 
licensed. If this is the case, you should restart Fusion 360.
Now it is time to unleash the whole power of the extension – in the following pages, we will explore 
most of the added commands to create advanced nesting management.
Material and sheet format
The first step is to specify the  sheet format we want to use for our production. Therefore, from the 
Manage  panel, launch the Process Material Library  command:
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 308
Figure 12.11: The Process Material Library panel
This window is the library where we can save and retrieve any metal sheet format. When first launched, 
we may have an empty library, but we can add more materials and formats for our daily operations. 
As we can see from the screenshot, at the moment, there is only a single material available, which is 
a Steel  sheet, 3 mm thick.
In addition to the material type, we can find elements called Packaging  – those are basically the sheet 
format we can use. Since we decided to use a format of 1000x500 millimeters for the nesting, we can 
simply select one of the packages and then edit the Length  and Width  values on the right. This will 
ensure that all the nested parts will be placed inside the boundaries of our sheet.
In addition to the outer contour of our metal sheet, we can also specify an additional offset from the 
outer contour to prevent parts from being placed too close to the border. These options can be found 
inside the Nesting  tab (which is to the right of the General  tab):
Figure 12.12: The Nesting tab (Packaging.2)
For our example, I won’t add any offset, but such an option is especially useful when the metal sheet 
is not really squared or if there is a high degree of uncertainty about the placement of the sheet on 
the working bed.
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 309
Now that we understand how to set up the sheet format, we can move to the material itself. Let’s click 
on Steel - 3mm  to work with material parameters instead of packaging parameters:
Figure 12.13: The Nesting tab (Steel - 3mm)
In this Nesting  tab, we  can change how parts can be rotated onto the sheet to pack them together for 
nesting. By default, Fusion 360 tries to arrange components inside the sheet boundaries by rotating 
them at 90° intervals; most of the time, this is more than enough for a good result. However, if our 
components have very elongated shapes or have many edges and angles with weird values, we may 
need to try smaller angle steps.
To reduce the angle step, set the Deviation  angle to 90deg  and the Increment  angle to a value as small 
as we see fit; for example, we may set it to 5deg or similar.
Note
By default, Fusion 360 uses main rotation steps for part placement. As we can see in the previous 
screenshot, there are three options enabled: Rotate 90 , Rotate 180 , and Rotate 270 , which are 
the main fixed rotation steps.
Deviation  will add a tolerance to the fixed rotation step. So, a Deviation  angle of 90deg  will 
allow angles between 0° and 90° on each of the main rotation steps; this means that if all the 
main rotation steps are enabled, the part can be rotated from 0° to 360°.
Increment  is the rotation step used to find the best placement for the nesting.
Nesting is more or less  like playing Tetris, having the option to rotate the bricks with small angle 
steps. As you may expect, using small angles to generate the nesting will take more time, but in some 
situations, it’s definitely worth it. In our scenario, we don’t really need small rotational steps since all 
the parts are squared; therefore, we can leave the default values ( 0deg ).
Another option related to angles is Material grain ; this option has been created to take into account 
a possible material anisotropy . Using  this option, we can specify the direction of grains on the metal 
sheet; however, most of the time, we just have to leave the default value of 0deg .
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 310
Note
A material is defined as isotropic if its mechanical properties along all three of its directions 
are constant. In contrast, anisotropy happens when the mechanical properties change 
between directions. Metal sheets tend to have anisotropies along the direction of the grains 
(lamination direction).
Moving on, by using Frame width , we can specify the minimum distance of the nested part from 
the border, while Item separation  lets us set the minimum distance between parts. We will leave the 
default values for all these parameters; however, I thought it was important to review their usage to 
better understand the process.
Now that we have checked all the options to manage the sheet format and its material, we can jump 
to the part list!
The part list
I want to start off by saying that in this section, we won’t modify any parameter for the example we 
are working on, so if you wish to skip ahead, you can. However, I think it is quite important to get a 
complete understanding of how a nesting placement can be modified for each component.
There is a single panel called Component Sources  for managing parts for the nesting:
Figure 12.14: Sources location
We have already processed the material and its dimensions; however, we still need to specify which 
parts have to be included in the nesting and their requirements. This command lets us access a list of 
all the components in our assembly and allows us to override the parameters for each part individually:
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 311
Figure 12.15: The part list
Let’s review the window step by step since it’s quite rich with content:
• BOM QTY : This is the number of parts about to be used for the nest, and is useful when 
checking whether the calculated quantity matches our expectations. To change this value, we 
can use the Override Nest QTY  option and change the number of parts to be cut. Y ou may want 
to tweak this value if, for example, one of the parts previously cut featured defects or was lost.
• Nest Material : This is the material that the parts are going to be nested on. Please note that 
material, in this context, is intended as metal type and its thickness. In our example, all the 
parts have to be cut on a steel sheet 3 mm thick; that’s our material then. As always, we can 
change this value as well using Override Nest Material .
• Priority : This sets the order of importance regarding which part to cut first. A high priority 
will put the part on the first sheets, while a low priority will put it on the last sheets to be cut. 
For our example, we don’t need certain parts to be cut first; therefore, we can leave the default 
value of 1 for every component.
• Add a new component (+) : This allows you to add external components to the nesting.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 312
• Component Grain : This specifies a certain angle to orient a part with, taking advantage of the 
grain direction. By the way, if we want to check that the part is going to be oriented properly 
along the grain direction, we can check the placement preview on the bottom right of the window.
• Bind : This  option synchronizes all the remaining settings with those specified inside the material 
setup we mentioned in the previous section. If we untick it, we can manually adjust those for 
each part, one by one. For the example study, we can leave this option checked.
We have now discovered all we need to know about setting up the nesting, and it is now time to move 
on to create one.
Creating the part nesting
The command to create our nesting is right on the main toolbar:
Figure 12.16: Nesting command
Let’s click on the Create Nest Study  command and explore its options. The first tab we have to 
configure is called Study .
The Study tab
In the Study  tab, we can manage the number of components we want to create the nesting for:
Figure 12.17: The Nesting Study tab
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 313
Let’s suppose we want to cut enough components to be able to build three welded structures. To 
specify the total number of part kits we want to cut, we simply have to specify the value inside Job 
Quantity ; in our case, we go for 3 then.
Using Stack size , we can set how many metal sheets we want to stack for our nesting; with laser cutting, 
we should always just use a single sheet; therefore, we must keep this value at 1.
Note
Sheet stacking  is a manufacturing technique sometimes used with waterjet machines. In 
most situations, the waterjet doesn’t cut even nearly as fast as a laser machine can; however, to 
increase production, it is possible to stack multiple raw material sheets one on top of the other, 
and cut them at the same time.
I suppose this technique sounds amazing, but can you guess why it is never done on a laser 
machine? Laser machines heat the parts up to melting point; therefore, having multiple sheets 
piled up will always result in welding them together!
The Shape tab
Inside the Shape  tab, we can find another list of the components about to be placed inside the nesting:
Figure 12.18: The Nesting Shape tab
If we properly checked the Component Sources  panel, we shouldn’t have any surprises here, so we 
won’t look at this too much. The only option we will review is  Bind all shapes to sources  – this is 
quite a self-explanatory command, letting you auto-update the nesting in case any attribute of the 
material or its format changes.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 314
The Packaging tab
Inside the Component Sources  panel, we already specified the material and material thickness to 
use for our  parts. However, at the moment, we haven’t specified the material format (packaging) yet. 
This Packaging  tab lets us do just that:
Figure 12.19: The Nesting Packaging tab
As we can see, this window  is basically a list of sheet formats to use. At the moment, there is only a 
single format to be used, called Steel 1000x500x3 . At the bottom, we have a list of other sheet formats 
we may decide to use for the nesting. We can find in the list a format called Steel 500x500x3  that can 
be used as an alternative.
In the right column, we can find Inventory QTY , which is the maximum number of sheets available 
in our inventory. The default value is infinite ( ∞), meaning that we have no limit to the number of 
sheets to be used for nesting.
The important thing to remember is that we are not forced to use a single sheet format for our nesting, 
but instead, we can combine multiple formats for the calculation. This is very important, so let’s see why.
Let’s suppose we have a company that, as standard, uses metal sheets with a dimension of 1000x500. 
If they are standard, then the warehouse will have plenty of these sheets.
However, it is not hard to imagine that sometimes a nesting will not use the entire area of every metal 
sheet; for example, we may have a production batch that ended up using only half a metal sheet. Let’s 
suppose we now have one remaining metal sheet with a size of 500x500 and that we don’t want to scrap it!
If only we could mix the sheet formats for nesting calculation.
Well, it turns out that we can. We can simply add a new packaging format (which is 500x500) to the 
list with Inventory QTY  set to 1 and move it to the top of the list:
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 315
Figure 12.20: The Nesting Packaging tab
This way, the 500x500 sheet will be  used first. Then, Fusion 360 will resume part placements on the 
standard 1000x500 format. This can save tons of money and reduce material waste!
Global Parameters
The Global Parameters  panel is all about optimizing the parameters for placement performance:
Figure 12.21: The Nesting Global Parameters tab
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 316
We won’t change any of the default settings here, but we’ll still review them for better awareness of 
the process:
• Corner position : This sets where we want to place the origin of each nesting.
• Minimum/Maximum compute time : This lets us set limits on the computing time for the 
nesting. The reason is quite simple: nesting is an intensive task for our CPU; it can take several 
minutes depending on how many parts are to be nested and their shape complexity. Fusion 360 
will perform multiple attempts until the perfect optimization is reached. Sometimes, however, 
we may prefer to reduce computing time for a nesting pattern to be good enough. Most of the 
time (with basic components) we can leave these values unchanged.
• Desired yield (%) : This is the target nested area efficiency. So, what is nesting efficiency? It is 
a score that evaluates how much of the metal sheet is covered by parts. An efficiency of 100% 
means that the entire area is used, while an efficiency of 50% means that only half of the metal 
sheet is used. The default value is 80%, so if every sheet’s total area is covered by at least 80% 
with parts, the nesting engine stops further optimization. We will use this default value.
Note
Inserting crazy high values (such as 99%) will result in a maximum compute time interruption 
since it isn’t likely that any nesting could ever be so well optimized.
• Remnant optimization : If the sheet cannot be entirely covered with parts, using this option can 
manage the leftover area. This option lets us specify whether we prefer a leftover metal sheet 
with a minimum length, width, or both. For example, we may specify that we want a remnant 
sheet with measurements of 500x500 that we can use in the future.
The Output panel
The Output  panel  is the last panel we need to take a look at, and it is responsible for, well, the 
output results:
Figure 12.22: The Nesting Output tab
Creating a nesting with Fusion 360
 317
There aren’t many options to set here, as we already handled most of the hard stuff:
• Create manufacturing model : This option should be ticked if we intend to create a proper 
toolpath inside Fusion 360; as we will do this in the next chapter, we will tick it. If we simply 
want to create a .dxf  file with the contours of the nested parts, we can untick this option.
Note
Inside Fusion 360, it is possible to clone the 3D model developed inside the DESIGN  environment 
and change it a little for manufacturing needs without breaking the link with the original. Such 
a clone is called  a manufacturing model . In the case of laser cutting, we need a manufacturing 
model to arrange all the parts on a planar surface for nesting.
• Show part outlines : This is used to generate a .dxf  file of all the nested parts. Y ou should 
choose this if you want to use an external laser CAM other than Fusion 360. In our case, we 
won’t use an external CAM; therefore, we can leave this option unticked.
• Include stock : This displays the sheet contours around the nested parts; it is really useful to 
get an idea of the overall placement; therefore, I always set it.
Now we have gone through all of those panels, it’s now time to see the results:
Figure 12.23: Results
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 318
As we can see, we now have a new manufacturing model ( 1) called Nesting Study.3 , which contains a 
nesting called Nest.3  (2). Inside the nesting, we can find six sheet layouts ( 3). Clicking on one layout 
will show how the parts are positioned on the sheet area ( 4).
We can also find more details regarding nesting. We just have to right-click on Nesting Study.3  (note 
that your name may change) and click on Compare :
Figure 12.24: The Compare option
This will lead us to the following panel that contains everything we will ever need to know about 
the nesting:
Summary
 319
Figure 12.25: Nesting details
Here, there is a list of every sheet created for the nesting with its area Efficiency , its Quantity , and its 
Packaging . We can also find quite a useful preview with all the parts highlighted in different colors.
I’m pretty sure that now you have a better idea of why the Nesting extension is better than the Arrange 
command: it gives us much more power and flexibility!
Summary
That’s the end of the chapter. We have now covered a large number of concepts and options for nesting. 
Let’s briefly recap what we went through.
First, we analyzed our welded example part and the components it’s made of. Then we found out how 
sheet formats and batch lot numbers can affect the efficiency of nesting.
Nesting Parts for Laser Cutting 320
After that, we found an easy way to create nested geometries using Fusion 360’s Arrange  command, 
though it’s quite a simple and limited way to approach nesting optimization. So instead, we explored 
a Fusion 360 extension focused on nesting creation and covered all the options for material and 
packaging setup.
Lastly, we created the nesting itself, discovering how to reuse metal sheets only partially used by 
previous operations.
All the points and hints discussed are critical for competitiveness in the manufacturing market.  
I hope that, even if we only had a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg, this still lets you become a better 
and more prepared designer.
Preparing a good nesting is very important, but we still need to learn how to cut the nested parts. 
Therefore, in the next chapter, we will find out how to create a cutting toolpath for our laser machine 
using Fusion 360.13
Creating Our First Laser  
Cutting Operation
In this chapter, we will find out how to implement a laser cutting setup and a cutting operation to 
process one of the nested layouts created in Chapter 12 .
The goal of this chapter is to give you a general understanding of the process of laser cutting, highlighting 
its complexities. In the process, we will also discover how and why cutting tabs should always be added 
and how to compensate for the cutting width of the laser beam.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Using Fusion 360 for laser cutting
• Creating a new setup for laser cutting
• Creating a new cutting tool
• Implementing our first cutting operation
Technical requirements
To follow along with this chapter, make sure that you have read Chapter 11  and Chapter 12 , as we are 
going to resume where we left off.
Using Fusion 360 for laser cutting
This chapter is intended to present all the features and commands that Fusion 360 offers. The goal is to 
create a cutting toolpath ready to be exported to our cutting machine. I aim for my explanations to be 
as clear and complete as possible; however, there are a few important limitations related to the subject.Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 322
As silly as it may sound, laser cutting is not similar to milling. In milling, there are multiple parameters 
ruled by simple formulas shared as standard by every milling machine brand. The chances are high 
that if we take a set of cutting parameters used to mill a part on a first CNC and use them on a different 
brand machine, they will work just as well. However, laser cutting is totally different. Every machine 
brand is different from its competitors and the number of variables to take into account is huge.
For a proper laser cutting operation, to list just a few parameters, we need to consider the material type, 
its thickness, its surface finish, and its behavior when exposed to a certain wavelength. In addition, 
we have to set the cutting gas to be used and the gas pressure, the shape of the nozzle, the laser power, 
and its pulses, not to mention the focal length of the lens and the focus position.
As you can imagine, all this stuff is really hard to measure or quantify and, for sure, is far beyond 
the skills of a mechanical engineer or a CNC operator (for sure, far beyond my skills!). That’s why, to 
keep things simple, every brand provides an integrated solution for CAM with a complete database 
that covers every possible scenario.
Fusion 360 doesn’t feature a cutting database; therefore, using it to generate laser cutting operations 
isn’t a great idea; it is doable but quite difficult at first since we have to renounce cutting databases 
integrated with other programs.
Therefore, a much better option is to use Fusion 360 from part design up to nesting operations and 
then export the nesting layouts as .dxf  files to other CAM programs centered on laser cutting.
Having said that, for the sake of completeness, during this chapter we will still use Fusion 360 to 
generate a toolpath, but we won’t be able to optimize cutting parameters much. We will work with 
very basic settings that are good enough for a hobbyist but not much more.
Now that we have warmed up a little bit, we can begin with the laser cutting setup.
Creating a new setup for laser cutting
At the end of the last chapter, we created a set of nested parts; now, it is time to move on and create a 
new setup, a fundamental step before any cutting operation.
To create a new setup, we can launch the SETUP  command from the FABRICATION  tab:Creating a new setup for laser cutting
 323
Figure 13.1: The Setup command
Once launched, we can explore the different tabs of the panel that appears.
The Setup tab
Inside the Setup  tab, we can find all the options to select the components to be included in the cutting 
setup and the position of the coordinate system:
Figure 13.2: Setup's Setup tab
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 324
The first option to check is Operation Type  – up until now, we have worked with Turning  and Milling ; 
this time, we shall set it to Cutting . Please note that a cutting setup can be used for laser cutting, 
plasma cutting, or waterjet; there is no difference for Fusion 360.
In the Work Coordinate System (WCS)  subpanel, in the Orientation  and Origin  drop-down menus, 
we can set the position of the coordinate system and its orientation. This process is identical to what 
we already found for turning or for milling; we just have to check that the axis orientation and origin 
match our machine.
In the example, we can see that the Z axis is pointing upwards and that the X axis is pointing along 
the major dimension of the metal sheet, which is the typical axis configuration of most machines.
Inside the Model  subpanel, we can find the options to pick the geometry to include in the setup. Using 
the Manufacturing Model  drop-down menu, we can pick the nesting we plan to create the setup for. 
At the moment, the selected nesting is Nest.3-Sheet.135 , which is one of the several metal sheets we 
created in Chapter 12  (we can find the nesting layout on the left of the diagram).
Note
We have to create a setup for each metal sheet we plan to cut. Since these setups would be 
almost identical, in this chapter, we will create a single setup for a single sheet and forget about 
all the others.
Then, using the Model  selection tool, we can individually select parts to be included in the setup. If 
we skip this selection, all the parts inside the nesting will be automatically included. In our case, we 
want to cut all the parts; therefore, we can leave the selection box blank.
The Stock tab
The Stock  tab lets us specify the overall dimensions of the metal sheet we plan to cut:Creating a new setup for laser cutting
 325
Figure 13.3: Setup's Stock tab
If you created the nesting using the Nesting and Fabrication extension, you don’t have to change anything 
here since the stock will be automatically set correctly. Here, the Stock Dimensions  measurements 
are already set to 1000x500x3, which is the packaging format we used for our nesting in fact.
Just in case you didn’t use the nesting extension, you will need to manually specify the dimensions 
much as we did for the milling example.
The Post Process tab
Inside the Post Process  tab, we can handle the WCS offset  and give a name and a comment to the 
CAM program created by the setup:
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 326
Figure 13.4: Setup's Post Process tab
A proper naming convention with multiple sheets is critical for remembering the sheet and the 
quantity to cut.
For Program Name/Number , I suggest you name it with a hint containing the sheet number and 
the quantity needed.
In our example, we need to cut six different sheets to build three welded parts; therefore, a proper 
naming convention for the G-code file may be something like WeldedAssembly_Sheet1of5 .
That is all we need to know for the setup creation, so now we can press OK and move on to the next 
section, where we will create a laser tool to use for the cutting operation.
Creating a new cutting tool
Fusion 360 comes with quite a limited range of laser tools – actually, there is only one at our disposal. 
As you may guess, such a limited library spells trouble for us since, this time, there aren’t plugins or 
libraries to use; the fastest way is to duplicate the existing tool and change it to our requirements.
To duplicate a tool inside the library, we can simply right-click on it, copy the tool using the Copy 
tool option, and then paste it inside the local library:
Creating a new cutting tool
 327
Figure 13.5: Copy tools
My suggestion is to rename the tool with a name that precisely describes the tool’s intended use; in 
our example, I will rename it: Fiber 4KW Steel 3mm O2 .
In order to edit the copied tool, we simply right-click on it and select Edit tool :
Figure 13.6: Edit tool
When editing the tool, we will focus on two tabs: the Cutter  and Cutting data  tabs.
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 328
The Cutter tab
First, let’s take a look at the Cutter  tab:
Figure 13.7: The Cutter tab
Inside the Cutter  tab, there are two parameters we can specify:
• Nozzle diameter : This is the diameter of the hole where the laser beam and the jet of gas are 
emitted. A typical nozzle diameter can range between 1 mm and 4 mm depending on the type 
of cut. We will keep the default settings of 1.5 mm .
Creating a new cutting tool
 329
• Kerf width : This is the cut width, which is the most important parameter to set since it drives 
the compensation of the cutting centerline. This parameter is highly dependent on the material 
thickness, the cutting power, and the lens our laser head is equipped with. However, considering 
a fiber source of 4 kW and a mild steel sheet of 3 mm, typical values may range between 0.2 and 
0.4 mm, therefore we may keep the default value of 0.4 mm . Since we don’t have a database, this 
is a tentative value; after the first part is cut, we shall check the real width of the cut, measure 
the part’s dimensions, and adjust this value accordingly.
The Cutting data tab
The Cutting data  tab is quite important and yet difficult to set. I must confess that I’m not an expert 
on setting laser parameters without the support of a material database; however, let’s go through this 
tab together. We will just review the meaning of most of the parameters; forgive me but I’m not skilled 
enough to suggest a proper value for all of them:
Figure 13.8: The Cutting data tab
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 330
Let’s review all the points together:
• Cutting feedrate : This is the cutting speed that will be used in the operation. The default 
value is 1000 mm/min, which is definitely a very slow pace of movement. Considering that we 
are creating a tool to be used with a fiber laser of 4 kW cutting a 3mm thick steel panel using 
oxygen, I think that a feed of 3800-4200 mm/min makes much more sense. For the example, 
let’s be conservative and go for 3800 mm/min .
• Cut height : This is the distance between the metal sheet and the tip of the nozzle.
• Pierce height : Piercing  is the first phase of a cutting process, where the laser beam has not yet 
gone through the entire metal thickness. So, this height option is the distance between the tip 
of the nozzle and the metal sheet when piercing.
• Cut Power  and Pierce power : This is the power sent to the laser source during normal cutting 
and piercing.
• Pierce time : This is the amount of time the laser will require to go through the metal sheet.
• Pressure : This is the pressure of the assist gas.
• Assist gas : This is the type of gas to be used for the cutting operation. For our example, we 
are cutting mild steel; the fastest performances for this material are achieved using Oxygen .
Now that we have created our new laser tool, we can save and accept the options and get back to the 
cutting operation.
Implementing our first cutting operation
There is one single cutting command available, called 2D Profile . We can find this in the FABRICATION  
tab, then inside the CUTTING  drop-down menu:
Figure 13.9: The 2D Profile command
Please note that in contrast to milling or turning, laser cutting is just a simple operation (there aren’t 
complex machining strategies). Let’s review the command together.
Implementing our first cutting operation
 331
The Tool tab
As we have seen, the To ol  tab lets us choose the cutting tool and its cutting speed:
Figure 13.10: The 2D Profile Tool tab
First of all, we have to choose the cutting tool for the cutting operation. As we can see from the screenshot, 
using the Select  option, we can pick the laser tool we just created ( Fiber 4KW Steel 3mm O2 ).
Choosing the proper cutting tool is important, but we also have to set the Cutting Feedrate  used for 
the operation. Most of the time, this requires us to manually insert the speed value.
However, since we already set the Cutting Feedrate  during the tool creation, it is already retrieved 
inside this panel, and as we can find from the screenshot, it is properly set to 3800 mm/min .
Now that both the cutting tool and the feedrate are set, we must be sure that the proper cutting mode 
is selected. The default Cutting Mode  is called Through – auto ; this is the default cutting preset to 
cut through the metal sheet (and therefore, it is the option we shall pick for the example).
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 332
However, let’s take a look at the other options:
Figure 13.11: Cutting presets
As we can see, there are several cutting modes: all the options labeled as Through  are used as cutting 
presets, while Etch  lets us engrave the material without cutting it, and Vaporize  is used to remove 
the plastic film on the top of certain sheets. All these different operations are managed by controlling 
the laser's intensity and its pulses, as well as the gas pressure.
The Geometry tab
This tab is one of the most important for the success of our cutting operation. Here we have to set the 
geometry to be cut and the tabs:
Figure 13.12: The 2D Profile Geometry tab
Implementing our first cutting operation
 333
Let’s review all the options available since they are quite critical:
• Contour Selection : This selection tool lets us pick the contours of the parts we want to cut.
• Select Same Plane Faces : When there are lots of components to select (which is most of the 
time), a much better option is to select a single contour and then flag this option to pick every 
other contour of the nesting. This is something we shall definitely do for this example.
• Loops : First of all, what is a loop? A loop is a closed profile inside the nested parts; it can be 
the outer contour that defines the shape of the part or an inner contour that defines the shape 
of a hole. This option lets us select which set of loops we want to cut with the cutting operation 
we are creating. We have three options to choose from:
 Inner loops : Choosing this option will select only the closed holes inside our parts for cutting
 Outer loops : Choosing this option will select only the outer contours of the parts for cutting
 All loops : Choosing this option will select all the inner loops of a part and then its outer 
loop for cutting (this is the setting we should select right now)
Note
In cutting, the best procedure is to cut the inner loops of a part first and then its outer loop. Cutting 
the outer contour first will likely result in the part moving when cutting its internal geometry.
• Side : This option considers the kerf 's width to adjust its position on the contour.
As we just mentioned, any nested part is defined by its inner and outer loops. To be a little more 
specific, we can say these loops are a set of 2D lines that defines the theoretical boundaries of 
the part. Having said that, we have to remember that a laser beam, despite being quite small, 
has a non-zero width of cut. Therefore, in order to respect the dimensions of the part, we 
have to compensate for the beam position taking into account its size. As we can see from the 
diagram, the laser spot can be placed in the center, on the outside, or the inside of any contour:
Figure 13.13: Centerline compensation
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 334
When cutting an outer loop, the laser will be moved on the outside of the contour; this way, 
the outer dimension won’t be affected by the beam diameter. Vice versa, when cutting an inner 
loop, the laser should be placed on the inside of the loop; otherwise, the hole would be bigger 
than the theoretical value.
To consider both laser placement for outer loops and for inner loops, the best setting to choose 
is Start outside , which will work fine both for inner loops and outer loops.
The next set of options is used for tabs generation, but before taking a look at all the options, we will 
introduce what tabs are.
Tabs  are programmed interruption of cutting with the scope of holding the cut part in place. When 
cutting with lasers, the metal sheet is not held in position with a clamping device like in milling; it is 
simply laid down onto the machine bed. Not only is it not held in place, but also the machine bed is 
made of sharp spikes that only touch the metal sheet on certain spots; therefore, cut parts are quite 
free to move and rotate:
Figure 13.14: Tabs
As we can see in the diagram, there are two parts nested on the metal sheet. The part on the right is 
being cut without tabs; therefore, some of the inner loops already cut have moved or tilted, and they are 
not planar with the rest of the metal sheet anymore. This means that the laser nozzle may collide with 
them and get damaged, whereas the part on the left was cut with tabs and nothing moved, meaning 
there was no danger of collision.
Now that we understand the importance of tabs, we can review the options that control their creation 
and their geometries:
• Tabs : With this option, we can enable tabs to reduce the chances of colliding with an already 
cut part. Since we are cutting complex profiles, this is a setting we should always enable.
Implementing our first cutting operation
 335
• Tab Width : This lets us choose how long tabs should be; longer tabs will hold better, but they 
will also require more effort to remove them manually. In our example, we will use 1 mm tabs.
• Tab Distance : This is the distance between two tabs. The shorter the distance, the more tabs 
will be created. For our example, we will use a tab distance of 50 mm .
The Heights tab
The Heights  tab sets the position of the laser nozzle during the cutting process:
Figure 13.15: The 2D Profile Heights tab
The most important value to set here is Retract Height , which controls the position of the nozzle 
when not cutting. It is a safety measure to prevent the head from colliding with parts already cut; as 
we just discovered, laser cutting is a process where the parts tend to move and flip, causing collision 
dangers for the laser head.
Having used the tabs, however, we can be quite confident of having solved the problem, therefore a 
retract Offset  of 25 mm  will be more than enough for our example part. All the other values can be 
left as default.
The Passes  tab and the Linking  tab can be left unchanged since the default settings are fine for 99.9% 
of cutting operations. Therefore, we can move to the next section and check the results.
Creating Our First Laser Cutting Operation 336
Simulation results
After simulating the generated cutting toolpath, we should get something similar to the following screenshot:
Figure 13.16: The results
As we can see, all the contours were cut, and we encountered no collisions.
In order to find potential issues, we have to look closer at the cutting path; in particular; we will always 
control the loops. We can zoom in close to the kerf to find whether the part dimensions are respected 
or whether the laser spot was misplaced.
As we found out back in Figure 13.13 , the laser spot is very tiny but it generates a width of cut; therefore, 
we should always check whether the generated toolpath is positioned on the right side of the geometry.
Long story short, if we are checking an outer contour, the toolpath should be on the outside of the 
contour, while when we check an inner loop, we should find the toolpath on the inner side of the hole.
Summary
 337
Figure 13.17: The cut details
Here, the result should be correct: the cutting toolpath has a constant offset on the outside from the 
part geometry (equal to half the cutting width). Therefore, the kerf is not reducing the part dimensions.
Now we can be quite confident that a proper toolpath has been generated. Congratulations!
Summary
This concludes the chapter and the section on laser-cutting technology. Overall, it has been quite a 
slim introduction to lasers since there aren’t many options related to laser cutting to play with inside 
Fusion 360.
However, to recap what we went through here, we first found out why Fusion 360 is not the best solution 
on the market to implement cutting operations by highlighting most of its weaknesses.
Then we created our first cutting setup using one of the nested layouts we created during Chapter 12 . 
While reviewing the options available for tool creation, we discussed a few important cutting parameters 
and their underlying importance.
Finally, we implemented the cutting operation itself and discovered the importance of tabs on the 
parts. Despite not being very detailed, I think this chapter was essential to get closer to the real world 
and its complexities.
It is now time to move to the next manufacturing technology: 3D printing!
Part 4 –  
Using Fusion 360 for  
Additive Manufacturing
In this part, we will focus on additive manufacturing, a technology capable of overcoming many of 
the limitations of conventional manufacturing processes. In doing so, we will present the different 
types of 3D printing machines, along with their pros and cons.
After an overall introduction to the topic, we will stick to the most common 3D printing process used 
by hobbyists and enthusiasts, FDM, and will try to find potential solutions to the typical limitations 
related to this process.
Once we have achieved a basic level of knowledge of 3D printers, we will return to Fusion 360 to 
create our first 3D printing operation.
Lastly, we will fully cover all the printing settings available inside Fusion 360 and learn their effects 
on the printing output.
This part includes the following chapters:
• Chapter 14 , Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing
• Chapter 15 , Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers
• Chapter 16 , Printing Our First Part
• Chapter 17 , Understanding Advanced Printing Settings14
Getting Started with Additive 
Manufacturing
In this chapter, we will discover a new production technique, 3D printing, also known by its more 
technical name, additive manufacturing .
In contrast to every other manufacturing technology that produces objects by removing material, this 
manufacturing method creates a component by adding material – hence the name additive  manufacturing.
This relatively new set of technologies has got cheaper and cheaper in recent years; as a result, 3D 
printing is now starting to overlap with traditional technologies for an increasingly wider range of 
production needs.
To become a better designer, it is important to be aware of alternatives to traditional legacy techniques. 
The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the main printing technologies and their differences to 
help you understand which one may fit your needs best.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Introducing additive manufacturing
• Exploring the pros and cons of 3D printing over conventional manufacturing processes
• Comparing different 3D printing technologies
Note
We will just focus on production scenarios related to the mechanical industry; however, please 
note that by the time this book reaches the shelves, new additive processes and solutions will 
have been released. Complete coverage of additive manufacturing is worth its own book.Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 342
Technical requirements
This chapter is a fresh restart on a new manufacturing technique; therefore, there aren’t special 
requirements. However, having read Chapter 1  and Chapter 6  will enhance your understanding of 
additive manufacturing’s potential.
Introducing additive manufacturing
Additive manufacturing is  a relatively recent manufacturing technology, dating back to the 1980s. As 
always, it is a bit difficult to give strict definitions, but let’s just say that most traditional production 
processes rely on removing unwanted material from a solid block of raw material (as a sculptor would 
do with a block of marble to create a statue).
Additive manufacturing is completely different; instead of removing material from a block, it focuses 
on creating the needed part by stacking very thin layers, one on top of the other.
Figure 14.1: An example of 3D printing
Since a 3D-printed object is created layer by layer, it is possible to create complex shapes not only on 
the outside of the part but also on the inside. Looking at the preceding figure, we can see an inner 
honeycomb pattern that reduces the overall weight of the part without compromising too much of 
its stiffness; such reinforcement can be created only with additive manufacturing.
This approach has so much potential, and it supports the creation of shapes otherwise impossible 
to manufacture.
Let’s find out the advantages and drawbacks of 3D printing compared to a legacy manufacturing 
process. Then, later in the chapter, we will discuss the different printing technologies.
Exploring the pros and cons of 3D printing over conventional manufacturing processes
 343
Exploring the pros and cons of 3D printing over 
conventional manufacturing processes
In this section, we will discuss most of the key features of 3D printing along with its advantages 
and drawbacks.
The pros of 3D printing
Additive manufacturing is not just a new manufacturing process that allows us to create parts in 
different ways. Additive manufacturing established a brand-new approach to part design that keeps 
opening new perspectives; it is a really complex field, rich with different technologies and applications 
under continuous development.
Complex shapes
One of the strongest arguments in favor of additive manufacturing is its flexibility to create very 
complex shapes, its  potential extending way beyond the capabilities of any other technology. The wide 
range of feasible shapes achieved is so incredible that it has opened the doors to a brand-new design 
approach that is often paired with 3D printing.
Let me introduce you to generative design .
Giving a precise definition of generative design is not very simple, but what we can say is that it uses 
advanced software capable of optimizing the shape of a part. A typical goal of this approach is to 
minimize the weight of a part and maximize its strength, which  is the type of extreme optimization 
sometimes needed in motorsports or aerospace industries.
But generative design  shapes rely on very complex geometries that are impossible to achieve by 
conventional technologies, which is why it often comes hand in hand with additive manufacturing, 
as this is the sole process capable of creating such components.
Figure 14.2: Generative design output
Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 344
In the preceding figure, the shape of the triangle is very intricate and impossible for any conventional 
approach, but with 3D printing, it’s not much more than a routine part!
To cut a long story short, whatever the shape, you can be confident that it can be printed (if you can 
afford it).
Rapid prototyping
Another benefit of additive manufacturing is its capability of delivering  functional prototypes at an 
inexpensive cost compared to other technologies. Let’s take the following injection-molded part as 
an example:
Figure 14.3: Injection-molding prototyping
The photo in the preceding figure shows quite a complex injection-molded part. As you may imagine, 
such a complex shape requires very complex (and expensive) molds.
Until not so long ago, the only way to create such a prototype would have been based on creating 
provisional  molds for testing purposes. As you can imagine, prototyping is more about trial and 
error, so producing a mold for every prototype part can become quite expensive and unsustainable.
That’s where additive manufacturing comes in – printing an object doesn’t require any costly equipment, 
and it can produce multiple prototypes, each with its own shape. It should, therefore, come  as no 
surprise that many people refer to additive manufacturing as rapid prototyping !
Production molds can easily cost several tens of thousands of euros (or even more, depending on 
complexities and dimensions), and provisional molds are always necessary to ensure that a final 
prototype can work flawlessly.
However, thanks to 3D printing, it is possible to create a provisional mold once the shape has been 
already optimized and passed through multiple 3D-printed steps.
Exploring the pros and cons of 3D printing over conventional manufacturing processes
 345
This way, we can drastically reduce start-up costs by reducing the number of molds and equipment 
needed during the prototyping process.
Just in time supplying
What does just in time  mean? It’s a rather common approach of getting components without managing 
a large warehouse stock – components arrive at the company when they are needed or just before.
However, building or servicing complex assemblies is not a simple task; multiple elements have to be 
assembled together at the right time to sustain the scheduled production rate.
Let’s suppose that we are a car manufacturer and that we have to assemble 100 cars every month. It 
turns out that our warehouse is out of stock on a certain component that must be installed in our 
cars in the middle of the assembly process. This is a very common situation nowadays for a variety of 
reasons: suppliers are late with their deliveries, a bad batch of components was rejected by the quality 
control office, and so on.
We definitely cannot afford to stop production waiting for components to arrive, as a company would 
lose lots of money. However, if such a missing part can be created via additive manufacturing, we may 
have the option to print it instead!
These days, there are several aerospace companies experimenting with 3D printing as a possible supply 
chain; instead of shipping a physical component overseas, it can be possible to just send a file to be 
printed. As you can imagine, such an approach has the potential of revolutionizing the industry once 
and for all; however, it’s not a well-established supply chain yet.
Composites
A composite  is a material where two or more different materials are combined to achieve better 
mechanical performances than the originals.
A typical example would be carbon fiber objects – they are made with several layers of carbon fiber 
cloth, Nomex honeycomb, and resin that hold everything together. These objects are very light and 
strong, which is why they are used in Formula One cars; however, they are also incredibly expensive 
and difficult to laminate.
3D printers can create composite objects too – a printed composite material is based on simple 
polymers, such as ABS or Nylon, reinforced with short carbon fibers, which further enhances the 
mechanical properties of the component.
The overall strength of a 3D-printed part reinforced with carbon fiber won’t be as good as a laminated 
part created with traditional techniques, but it’s still way better than plastic only!
In the following figure, there are two components; the one on the left has been 3D-printed using 
carbon reinforcements, while the one on the right has been laminated with a traditional process using 
carbon fiber sheets.Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 346
Figure 14.4: A carbon fiber duct
I really love carbon, and I risk digressing too much, so let’s just say that a traditional carbon fiber 
component usually has better properties than a 3D-printed counterpart, but it is also way more 
expensive and time-consuming, since most of the lamination process relies on handmade steps. On 
the other hand, a printed carbon part can be the sweet spot between strength, weight, and costs.
Therefore, having the option to print using composites is the cherry on the icing on the cake that you 
don’t want to miss.
The cons of 3D printing
Today, it is still unlikely to find a 3D-printed part in our daily lives, as additive manufacturing is not 
a mass production technique. Unfortunately, it probably never will – let’s look at the main limitations 
that stop this technology from becoming more widely used.
Scalability
Scalability is the biggest issue related to additive manufacturing; not only is printing a part this way 
not cheap but also the cost is almost constant, whatever the production lot volume. Printing a single 
part, tens of parts, or tens of thousands of parts will always cost almost the same; it is not possible to 
reduce the cost significantly.
The cost of a printed part can be composed of the following components:
• The print material : The cost of the material composing the printed part.
• The support material : The cost of the additional geometries used to stabilize the printed parts. 
These structures are needed for certain additive processes and complex geometries.
• The working time of the machine : The cost per hour of the machine being used.
• Electricity : The cost of the power used to print a part.
Exploring the pros and cons of 3D printing over conventional manufacturing processes
 347
As we found out, there is no startup cost or equipment cost to distribute over the number of parts 
produced. This is a strong point in favor of additive manufacturing with small production volumes, 
but it is also its Achilles heel with mass production.
Let’s consider the following component being produced using both additive manufacturing and 
injection molding:
Figure 14.5: An example component
Both technologies are more than capable of realizing the shape of the part. The cost of the printed part 
can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as printing technology, material type, surface finish, and 
so on, but let’s suppose that printing this part using additive manufacturing may cost around 10 euros.
On the other hand, injection  molding has a huge cost, due to the initial mold creation.
However, such an important cost can be diluted on the parts – if the production numbers are high 
enough, the cost of the mold will increase its price tag by a very tiny fraction.
Imagine that we have to produce a component whose mold costs around 10,000 euros. Let’s find out 
what happens when diluting the mold cost into the production volume:
Figure 14.6: The molding cost versus production volume
Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 348
On the X axis of the chart, we can find the production volume, while on the Y axis, there is the cost 
of a single component. There are two lines – the orange sloping one depicts the production cost for 
molded parts, while the blue horizontal one is additive manufacturing.
On the left of the chart, we can see that injection molding is way more expensive than additive 
manufacturing, since the mold cost is heavy when distributed on just a few parts. However, once the 
cost of the mold is split over a large number, we reach a break-even point with additive manufacturing 
(in the example, around 1,000 parts). For larger amounts of components, injection molding will be 
cheaper, and cheaper than 3D printing.
That’s why additive manufacturing is never going to be a mass production technology – most of the 
time, it is simply  more expensive than other technologies.
A limited range of materials
Another disadvantage of additive manufacturing is the range of materials available for printing. Don’t 
get me wrong – today’s 3D printers are printing everything, from metals to human cells, and so there 
is quite a large library, but it is still limited.
Limited part dimensions
Additive manufacturing is a rather complex process that requires a finely controlled environment; 
that’s the main reason why 3D printers, generally speaking, do not have large build volumes. As you 
can imagine, there are exceptions – someone out there is probably printing jet turbines or even houses; 
however, generally speaking, we can be sure that a part with boundaries of 500 x 500 x 500 mm is 
going to be quite difficult to print in one piece only.
This is due to the fact that most printers on the market have a build volume of less than 250 x 250 x 
250 mm (and sometimes way less than that). This volume limitation is quite restrictive for several 
mechanical components. There is always the option of slicing the part into multiple sub-components 
to glue together, but the process is never flawless; that’s why I decided to include build dimension as 
a drawback for additive manufacturing.
This is all that you need to know about additive manufacturing. To cut a long story short, additive 
manufacturing can achieve terrific shapes at compelling costs for small batches; however, it is inferior 
to other production processes if higher quantities are needed or the part dimensions are quite large.
Let’s now jump to the next section, where we are about to discover the main differences between the 
three most common additive processes.
Comparing different 3D-printing technologies
Choosing the proper additive technology for our project is essential if we want it to seriously compete 
with other production techniques. That’s why we are about to discuss all of them in detail now.Comparing different 3D-printing technologies
 349
Fused deposition modeling
Fused Deposition Modeling  (FDM ) is the cheapest additive manufacturing process and, therefore, 
is the most common technology used by small companies and hobbyists.
In the following diagram, we can find a basic simplification of the process:
Figure 14.7: The FDM process
First, the printing material is supplied via a large spool of plastic filament ( 1). This filament is then 
forced into a hot end extruder ( 2) that melts the plastic and deposits a thin layer of material on the 
build plate ( 3).
Note that the interior of the part ( 4) is not solid, so by using this technology, it is possible to create a 
honeycomb infill. This type of infill pattern reduces the overall weight of the part (and material usage) 
without compromising its strength. (Check out Figure 14.1  for a closer look at the infill pattern.)
Also, note that we are also using support material – in the diagram in Figure 14.7 , we can find multiple 
pillars of printed material ( 5), with the sole responsibility of supporting yet-to-be-printed overhang areas.
The last thing I’ d like to  highlight, as silly as it sounds, is that the motion of the extruder relative to the 
build platform happens on the three main axes ( X, Y, and Z). As we are about to discover, not every 
other additive process relies on this type of movement.
Now, let’s quickly review the most important points to understand FDM technology by looking at its 
advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are as follows:
• Multi-material support : The material is fed via a spool and printed using an extruder; therefore, 
thanks to the low complexity of this process, it is possible to have multiple extruders working 
together. Using multiple nozzles, each extruding a different material in parallel, lets us create 
multi-material objects. For example, by using a stiff filament and a rubber filament, it is possible 
to print a complete toy car wheel with the tire and the rim in one shot! This is the only printing 
technology that supports multi-material objects.
Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 350
• Very cheap and simple : An FDM 3D printer is a rather basic machine; it is based on a moving 
platform, a heating cartridge, and a nozzle. No lasers or complex sensors are required; as long 
as the plastic is melted at the right temperature and with the right flow, it will print just fine.
• Large build volumes : Thanks to their simplicity, FDM printers tend to have a rather large build 
volume compared to other 3D printing technologies.
The disadvantages of FDM are as follows:
• Surface finish : Despite having improved a lot in recent years, it is still possible to spot an 
FDM-printed part at first glance. This type of additive technology always leaves visible markings 
on the sides of the part, making it look a bit cheap compared to other additive processes. Using 
FDM denies a part any glossy finish or transparent look; therefore, this type of technology is 
often used for hidden structural parts or early prototypes only.
• Support material : FDM printing requires the positioning of support material to sustain 
overhanging areas of the part. These pillars have to be manually removed after the print is  
complete, and they basically become material waste.
• Details and resolution : Not only do FDM printers not grant a great surface finish, but they also 
aren’t capable of printing very small details or reaching tight tolerances, which is something to 
consider when prototyping functional parts of a mechanism!
Now that we’ve had a look at this first additive technology, let’s jump to the next one – stereolithography.
Introducing stereolithography
Stereolithography  (SLA ) is by far my  favorite additive process. Let’s find out why I love it so much 
and what it relies on by looking at the following diagram:
Figure 14.8: The SLA process
Comparing different 3D-printing technologies
 351
As we can immediately spot from the picture, an SLA 3D printer is rather different from an FDM 
machine. First of all, the build platform ( 1) just moves up and down and the part is printed upside 
down. The printing material is a special liquid resin sensitive to UV radiations (you can find out more 
about this in Figure 11.1 ), which is pumped inside a tank ( 2) where the part plunges while printing. On 
the bottom of the tank, there is a UV light source ( 3) focused on the bottom of the part; controlling 
the UV light, it is possible to solidify the geometry layer by layer.
Since the resins are sensitive to UV light, this type of printer features UV screen protection ( 4). This 
cover is not intended as a safety protection against our eyes but, rather, a protection for the liquid 
resin against sunlight! Since the resin is UV-sensitive, normal light can easily  trigger polymerization  
and ruin the printing process.
Note
To keep things simple, let’s just say that polymerization is a chemical process where molecules 
get bound together with a certain arrangement to create a polymer-like plastic.
Like the previous printing process, we can find support material structures with complex shapes ( 5) 
that support overhanging  areas and that connect the printed part to the build plate.
Let’s now find out the most important features of this technology, again by looking at the advantages 
and disadvantages. The advantages are as follows:
• Surface finish : This is, hands down, the best printing quality achievable by an additive 
manufacturing process. Stereolithography not only grants very smooth and shiny parts but is 
also the only 3D-printing technology that can print transparent components!
• Highest precision : SLA not only excels in terms of surface finish but also prints very tiny details 
with great precision, which is why it is often used for miniatures.
• Materials : In recent years, the number of available resins has increased significantly, and several 
third-party companies are offering multiple solutions to cover a wider range of mechanical, 
thermal, and aesthetic properties.
The disadvantages of SLA are as follows:
• Costs : Among all the additive manufacturing processes, stereolithography is probably the 
most expensive. Not only is this type of 3D printer definitely not budget-friendly, but also one 
kilogram of resin is way more expensive than a kilogram of any other additive manufacturing 
printing material.
• Support material : Similar to FDM, this process requires support structures that have to be 
manually removed before post-processing begins.Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 352
• Curing : Once finished, the printed part is covered in unpolymerized resin residue that must 
be washed with an alcoholic solution. This wash creates a special waste difficult to dismiss 
and is definitely not disposable with water down your sink! Depending on the resin, after this 
alcoholic bath, most of the time the resulting part remains sticky. Therefore, the part has to be 
cured with special UV lights that complete  the polymerization. This is quite a long and complex 
post-processing of the parts – in my opinion, it is the worst drawback of this technology.
We just discovered that stereolithography is not as straightforward as other technologies and requires 
a long post-production process to achieve the final part. However, after all these steps, we can enjoy 
a very nice print result!
Now, let’s look at our last additive technology – selective laser sintering.
Introducing selective laser sintering
Selective Laser Sintering  (SLS) is probably the most flexible process and has several key differences 
from the  others worth analyzing. In the following diagram, we can find a basic illustration of an SLS 
3D printer:
Figure 14.9: The SLS process
With SLS, the raw material used for printing is not resin or a plastic filament, it uses nylon powders 
instead. The printed part ( 1) is created inside the build volume ( 2), which is gradually filled with new 
layers of powder. Layer by layer, the build platform ( 3) moves toward the bottom of the machine, 
and a new layer is deposited on top of the previous one by a special distributor ( 4). A laser is then 
responsible for heating and melting the powder particles together, forming a solid part.
Summary
 353
This is a really  smart process not affected by many of the problems of other processes. Let’s take a 
look at some of its advantages:
• No support material : Since the part is printed inside a volume of powder, it doesn’t need to 
touch the build platform in any way; therefore, support structures are not needed. This is a 
huge advantage, since we don’t have to worry about support material and how the support 
structures will connect to the build platform, meaning the entire build volume can be used to 
print as many parts as it is possible to fit inside, increasing productivity (the highest among 
the other 3D printing processes).
• Most complex designs : With this type of printing process, it is possible to create working 
mechanisms straight from the build volume; using SLS machines, we can print entire assemblies, 
and as long as there is a layer of powder between components, they won’t jam. This is not as 
easy as it sounds, but with a simple mechanism, it is definitely doable.
• Surface finish : The surface finish, though not as good as most SLA prints, is generally good.
• Material cost : Since the print material is nylon powder, it is cheap, reusable, and can be 
recycled easily.
The disadvantages of SLR  are as follows:
• Cost : Between the three technologies presented, an SLS printer is the most expensive
• Printing material library : The available choice of materials to print is quite limited, being 
mostly bound to nylon and a few other polymers
Now that we have explored  all these interesting printing technologies, I’ d really like to know which 
one is your favorite!
Summary
This concludes the chapter – I hope that your journey with additive manufacturing will be a source 
of new ideas and a starting point to discover different approaches to part design.
Let’s recap together what we discovered during this chapter. At first, we discussed what additive 
manufacturing is and how it is different from other legacy production processes. After this, we 
explained in which scenarios additive manufacturing should be considered a possible alternative to 
other technologies. Most notably, we found out why 3D printers are a valuable solution for prototypes 
and the advantage of additive flexibility in just-in-time supply chains.Getting Started with Additive Manufacturing 354
In the final section, we analyzed one by one the most common printing technologies (FDM, SLS, and SLA), 
comparing their features and drawbacks. Understanding all these points is very important; sometimes, 
a designer is bound to old ideas or old shapes driven by legacy manufacturing techniques. Grasping 
the innovation of additive manufacturing can lead to new solutions and new unforeseen scenarios.
Now, follow me to the next chapter, where we are about to discuss how to optimize the setup process 
of an FDM part.15
Managing the Limitations of 
FDM Printers
We just discovered that additive manufacturing is quite an incredible technology, capable of creating 
any shape. But despite being very flexible, 3D printing is still bound to limitations that we must 
consider when approaching a new part study.
In this chapter, we are going to try answering the following question: can an FDM 3D printer create 
every imaginable geometry? The answer is… almost. We must understand that this type of printing 
technique has some limitations – some related to part shape, others to material properties.
In this chapter, we will cover the three main limitations of FDM printers that we have to consider:
• The first limitation is printing overhang areas; some geometries can be a bit challenging to 
print if not properly supported
• The second limitation is bed adhesion, which is related to the first layer placement; if the contact 
area between the printed part and the build platform is not large enough, the part might vibrate 
or detach from the platform while printing
• The third limitation, which is a bit more technical, is about anisotropies
After presenting these limitations, we will try to find a possible solution to these common issues by 
setting up a proper part placement or orientation.
However, as we are about to discover, sometimes it is not possible to fulfill every requirement, and 
then we will have to find a compromise. Understanding how to set up a component for printing can 
make the difference between a successful print and a waste of time and money. That’s why this chapter 
should be read carefully!Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers 356
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Printing overhang geometries
• Understanding bed adhesion
• Understanding anisotropies of the printed part
• Choosing the first layer placement and part orientation
Technical requirements
The only requirement for this chapter is to have read and understood Chapter 14  – in particular, the 
section about FDM printers.
Printing overhang geometries
Overhang areas are sloped faces  that protrude beyond the base of our model. We actually already 
faced a similar concept, undercuts, when studying milling issues:
Figure 15.1: Undercuts for milling
As we may recall, undercuts  are geometries that cannot be reached by the cutting tool, they are a huge 
limitation to milling processes even if we already found several possible solutions to fix undercuts 
in Chapter 7 .
In this section, we will focus on additive manufacturing to find out whether undercuts are an issue 
that affects FDM printing as well, and if so, how.
Printing overhang geometries
 357
Facing overhangs (undercuts) in 3D printing
Before jumping to the  answer, let’s get back to basics – additive manufacturing, instead of removing 
material from a solid block, creates a shape by stacking multiple layers one on top of the other.
For this reason, generally speaking, 3D printers don’t suffer undercut-related issues nearly as much 
as milling or other legacy technologies. Let’s investigate a little bit more into why.
Figure 15.2: Undercuts for FDM
As we already know and can see in the preceding diagram, the part is created layer by layer. While 
the printing process is in progress, the extruder gradually moves upward, leaving lower geometries 
untouched. This is the reason that there aren’t accessibility issues – the sloped face is not yet printed 
when the extruder moves in that area!
Unfortunately, there  is a catch – under certain circumstances, undercuts can lead to poor quality in 
our prints. Let’s check out a typical example:
Figure 15.3: A sudden section change
Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers 358
This time, on the left, the shape to be printed has a sudden section change instead of featuring a sloped 
undercut face. This is a huge problem for an FDM printer because this type of additive technology 
relies on stacking a layer on top of the last one – it cannot print a layer on top of thin air!
For this reason, as we can see, the unsupported area will never be printed properly; the bottom face 
will feature extruded layers bent and distorted toward the bottom.
In the following diagram, we can see a wider range of overhang geometries and their resulting prints:
Figure 15.4: Different undercuts angles
The geometry on the left has a surface with a draft angle of around 45° – most of the time, this is 
considered the limit for a successful print. Steeper faces (such as the center geometry) or upside-down 
faces (the right geometry) cannot be  printed properly.
So, now we understand the first FDM limitation – overhang areas are a bit challenging to print. But 
don’t be frustrated, as this limitation doesn’t have to restrict our imagination for new shapes. We still 
have an ace up our sleeve – support material.
Improving our prints using support structures
To cut a long story short, in order to avoid the extruder from extruding  material over thin air, it is 
possible to create dispensable structures with the sole purpose of giving the extruder a layer to print 
onto. In the following figure, we can see good use of support structures:
Printing overhang geometries
 359
Figure 15.5: Support structures
Here, the part ( 1) is being printed, and the extruder is about to encounter a sudden section change, 
similar to what we analyzed in Figure 15.4 . This time, however, instead of printing over thin air, there 
is a block of thin support structures ( 2) that will sustain the following layers.
These structures (generally referred to as support material) have to be manually removed once the 
print is complete. Therefore, they must be stiff enough to support the upper layers but also fragile and 
light enough to be removed without damaging the printed part.
Note
Y ou may also have noticed from the diagram that it depicts two different colors – a darker 
one for the printed part and a lighter one for support material. With FDM printers featuring 
multiple extruders, it is possible to print support structures with water-soluble material – for 
example, PV A – that will leave no residue after being submerged in water.
As simple as it may sound, support structures are an optional help to support overhang geometries. 
If we can find a part placement that doesn’t need support, then choose that part orientation instead.
If we print unnecessary support structures, there will be some downsides: the overall printing time 
will be longer, we will waste more material on the same object, and we will likely have a worse surface 
finish on the supported areas.
Note
Rule #1: Reduce support structures as much as possible.
As we will discover in Chapter 16  and Chapter 17 , creating  simple support structures is not a hard 
task, and it can be performed automatically by the software.
Something that should be carefully considered, however, is setting and adjusting part placement. We 
will try to understand the basic concepts of part placement in the next section.
Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers 360
Understanding bed adhesion
Every FDM printing process relies on printing the part from  the build platform of the 3D printer and 
stacking layers on top of it. As you can imagine, having the object perfectly glued to the build surface 
is super-important. It must not detach from the platform nor vibrate while printing; otherwise, the 
printing process will fail miserably.
Usually, the best prints are achieved when the area of contact between the build platform and the part 
is large enough to give perfect adhesion to the latter.
This is probably the most important rule for a successful print, and luckily, it is also quite simple to 
understand – we always have to put the larger and flattest area of our component in contact with the 
printing bed.
The reason behind this rule is quite intuitive; since the part, while printing, has to remain perfectly 
fixed to the printing bed, a larger contact area will grant better adhesion forces to counteract vibrations 
and local deformations. Let’s find a practical example that will further clarify this golden rule for 
FDM printers:
Figure 15.6: Different printing orientations
In the preceding figure, there are three different cylinders  printed and oriented in different ways on 
the printing platform:
• The first cylinder is laid down on the rounded side of the cylinder, meaning that the contact 
area between the component to be printed and the platform is very tiny (it’s a thin segment).
• The second cylinder is tilted and touches the build platform on an even smaller area; it’s a single 
point of contact between the bottom circle and the platform. Such a tiny area is way too small 
and unstable to be used as the first layer of contact. On the off chance that we do get a successful 
print, it will likely feature a very bad surface finish and distorted layers, to say the least.
Understanding anisotropies of the printed part
 361
• The third cylinder is the only proper way of orienting this shape, done by laying it on the base 
of the cylinder; this will provide much better adhesion to the build platform and won’t require 
support structures to have a chance of success.
Note
Rule #2 : Large flat areas must be laid on the bed plate.
Now that we have covered this second golden rule, we can move on to the last one, which is a bit more 
technical and complex to understand, since it involves material properties.
Understanding anisotropies of the printed part
FDM prints feature anisotropies along the printing direction. Typically, the mechanical strength 
between stacked layers is weaker than the strength in other directions; therefore, the higher loads 
should always be applied along the layers, not perpendicular to them.
We should always consider these anisotropies when studying part placement, especially if we are 
about to print a functional prototype that will be loaded by forces and deformations. Let’s take the 
following component as an example; this part is similar to a circlip ring and will act a bit like a spring:
Figure 15.7: Another example of different printing orientations
As you can see, there are two different part placements for this part; the first one on the left features 
the part standing up, while the second shows the part laid on its side.
Both part placements are feasible from a printing  perspective. However, since this is a component that 
will have to sustain forces, there is only a clear winner. Let’s analyze the different layer orientations 
to see which is the toughest:
Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers 362
Figure 15.8: The points of failure
On the first layer orientation, the force (labeled F), applied as illustrated, will generate high stress on 
the two arms of the part, likely resulting in a static failure of one of the two, with a crack parallel to 
the layers.
On the other hand, the second layer orientation will result in a much more flexible component that 
will be able to sustain higher abuses!
Note
Rule 3# : Be mindful of the layer orientation.
As we just discovered, choosing the best printing placement is not an easy task – it largely depends 
on the part itself, and there is no magic formula that helps us decide. Therefore, in this chapter, we 
will try to give best practices that may be a good starting point.
Please note that sometimes it is not possible to respect all these suggestions – sometimes, one is in 
open conflict with another, so we will then have to find a compromise. In the following section, we 
will try to find the best printing approach for a rather simple shape, while trying to find the best 
placement that respects all the given rules.
Choosing the first layer placement and part orientation
After reading the previous suggestions, you may find yourself a bit disoriented with all of the different 
limitations. So, considering those, let’s try to find the best part placement for the following component:
Choosing the first layer placement and part orientation
 363
Figure 15.9: Choosing the best printing orientation
Here, we can find all the possible printing orientations for the given part. Let’s analyze them and test 
whether the given rules are respected.
First, let’s look at placement 1:
• This placement requires quite a large volume of support material; therefore, the first rule is 
not really respected
• The first layer is quite large, and it will grant a good adhesion to the part; therefore, the second 
rule is respected.
• This type of layer placement will make the thin vertical wall very fragile; therefore, the third 
rule is not respected
Let’s look at placement 2:
• This placement requires quite a large volume of support material; therefore, the first rule is 
not really respected
• The contact area is very small; therefore, the second rule is also not respected
• Using this layer orientation, the horizontal wall will be flexible, but the vertical ones will be 
fragile; therefore, the third rule is not respected
Let’s look at placement 3:
• There is no support material; therefore, the first rule is respected
• There is quite a large area of contact between the part and the platform; therefore, the second 
rule is respected
• With this layer orientation, the thin walls are quite flexible; therefore, they won’t break as easily 
as the other placements
Managing the Limitations of FDM Printers 364
Let’s look at placement 4:
• There is no support material; therefore, the first rule is respected
• There is quite a large area of contact between the part and the platform, so the second rule 
is respected
• Using this layer orientation, the horizontal wall will be flexible, but the vertical ones will be 
fragile; therefore, the third rule is not respected
Having analyzed all the possible placements, we can safely say that the best way to go is placement  
3 – it can be printed very well thanks to a large contact area, won’t require support, and will also 
feature good mechanical properties.
Note that real-life parts are more difficult to make than a simple squared part shown in a book on Fusion 
360 CAM, but the basic rules are still the same. However, sometimes, we will have to find compromises 
or change the printing technology, with SLS being the most suitable for the most complex shapes.
Summary
That’s the end of the chapter. Let’s quickly recap what we explored.
First of all, we discovered overhangs in 3D printing and why they can cause trouble to printed parts. 
Then, we moved on to the most common approach for handling undercut-related issues, using 
support structures.
Lastly, we discovered how layer orientation and part placement can change the mechanical behavior 
of our components, and we gave a few practical suggestions on how to optimize orientation choice.
Getting an overall idea of the covered subjects is super-important for the proper use of additive 
manufacturing (and, in particular, FDM printers).
Now that we have a better understanding of FDM printing’s potential and its limitations, we can move 
on to the next chapter, where we are about to start our part setup and slicing journey!16
Printing Our First Part
Now that we’ve covered the general theory behind FDM additive manufacturing, we can move on to 
Fusion 360 and its CAM module.
In this chapter, we will approach an example part, starting from the setup and then reviewing the 
whole process. The goal of this chapter is to provide you with all the tools needed to create a G-code 
file to export to a 3D printer.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Presenting the model
• Creating a new printing setup
• Orienting the model onto the build platform
• Generating the support structures
• Simulating the toolpath
• Using the post-processor
Technical requirements
To understand this chapter, make sure that you have read and understood Chapter 14  and Chapter 15 , 
or have basic knowledge of 3D printing in general.
Presenting the model
Since  we are about to start creating a printing setup using Fusion 360, we should begin with a 3D 
model to use as an example part. The part we are about to print is a little bit more advanced than the 
examples covered in Chapter 15 . Here it is:Printing Our First Part 366
Figure 16.1: Example model
It’s quite a complex bracket with several mounting holes and multiple section changes. This type of 
geometry may be a bit challenging for milling, but it is feasible for additive manufacturing.
First, we must check if it can fit inside the print volume of our printer. The overall dimensions of the 
part are 45x107x45 mm, and I plan to print the part using a printer with a build volume of 230x150x140 
mm, so we shouldn’t find any issues with the dimensions.
Now that we have discovered that we can print the part, we also need to understand the forces it will 
have to sustain. I can tell you that this component is not loaded with any force, so the layer orientation 
won’t play an important role when choosing the printing orientation. Therefore, we can focus on 
choosing the part placement that minimizes the amount of support material needed.
The best placement is probably the one shown in the preceding figure since it will only require a tiny 
bit of support material to support the upper layers above the big hole.
Don’t be  too scared about part placement – if you don’t immediately find the best solution to orient 
a part on the build platform, you can always rely on automatic part placement algorithms, which will 
do this for you!
We will cover these types of commands in the Orienting the model onto the build platform  section.
Now that we have introduced the part we are about to print, we can launch Fusion 360 and dive into 
the MANUFACTURE  workspace.
Creating a new printing setup
The first thing we shall do is move to the ADDITIVE  panel inside the MANUFACTURE  workspace, 
where we will find every 3D printing command to play with. Then, from the SETUP  drop-down 
menu, select the New Setup  command:
Creating a new printing setup
 367
Figure 16.2: New Setup
The following panel is quite familiar and will be the same for any setup operation we face in terms of 
turning, milling, or cutting:
Figure 16.3: Setup’s Setup tab
The first thing we must check is that Operation Type  is set to Additive .
Printing Our First Part 368
Next, we can pick the 3D printer we want to use. This is not a mandatory step, but since 3D printers 
usually have quite a limited printing area, we must ensure that the object we want to print doesn’t exceed 
the maximum available printing dimensions. Choosing a machine will let us check its boundaries 
much easier.
To select a 3D printer, go to the Machine  panel and click on Select… . The following window will appear:
Figure 16.4: 3D printer library
Selecting a printer from the list lets us check its details on the Info  panel on the right.
There is quite a large machine library for desktop FDM printers – I’m going to choose my trusty 
Flashforge Dreamer, which features a double extruder and a build volume of 230x150x140 mm.
Once we’ve picked our 3D printer, we must click on Select  to get back to the Setup  window from 
Figure 16.3 .
Next, using the Model  selection tool, we can pick the 3D models we want to print; in our example, 
we picked the bracket shown in Figure 16.1 .
After that, there’s an important group of settings we must check, which can be reached using the Print 
Settings  button. Here, we can specify the material we want to use for printing:
Creating a new printing setup
 369
Figure 16.5: Print Settings
There are  already many printing settings to choose from. For this example, we are going to use the 
default setting, which is named ABS 1.75mm . As you may have guessed, ABS is the material we are 
about to print, while 1.75 mm is the diameter of the filament printable by our 3D printer. If your 3D 
printer features a bigger extruder, you can go for ABS 2.85mm , which is the other most common 
filament diameter.
Note
In Chapter 17 , we will dive much deeper into the printing settings, so we can leave the default 
settings as-is for now.
Now that we’ve covered the most important options for the Setup  tab, we can go to the Post Process  
tab. Here, we can create a custom name for the generated G-code file or add a comment:
Figure 16.6: Setting’s Post Process tab
Printing Our First Part 370
I would suggest calling the G-code file something that helps us remember the part’s shape. For example, 
for Program Name , we may enter something such as Bracket  or ExamplePart .
When using Program Comment , it is a good idea to always provide a recap of the printing settings 
or the 3D printer model; this way, even in a year or two, we will immediately know which machine is 
intended to be printed onto. Since I only have one FDM printer, I’ll go for a comment like ABS 1.75mm .
Now that the setup is complete, we can click on OK and look at the 3D environment:
Figure 16.7: Build volume
Since we selected a 3D printer from the machine library, we can find the boundaries of the printing 
volume. The part is way smaller than the build volume, but at the moment, it is badly oriented onto 
the build platform; printing the part this way would require tons of support material. We must flip 
the part upside down, as shown in Figure 16.1 , which we will do next.
Orienting the model onto the build platform
The contact area between the build platform and the 3D model is so important. We can safely say that 
90% of a successful print is due to the first layer. Therefore, as you can imagine, there is a whole set of 
commands to orient and place the part on the build platform however we see fit.
Alongside the standard Move Components  command we should already be familiar with, other 
specific tools in the POSITION  menu are worth discussing:
Orienting the model onto the build platform
 371
Figure 16.8: The POSITION menu’s commands
Let’s review them one by one.
Place parts on platform
The Place parts on platform  command  allows us to put every component we plan to print onto the 
build surface. For the example we are studying, this is not needed (since there is only one part and it is 
automatically oriented onto the build plate), but when printing multiple parts, we may have to use it.
Forget our example bracket for a moment – let’s focus on another example:
Figure 16.9: Place parts on platform (before)
Printing Our First Part 372
As we can  see, when there are multiple parts to print, they may not fit inside the printing volume as 
they are positioned in the 3D world. But by using the Selection  tool and flagging the Arrange  option 
(and then clicking OK), we can change their position and put them onto the build platform (this is 
something like a 3D nesting operation!).
After running the command, all the parts will be inside the build volume and touching the build surface:
Figure 16.10: Place parts on platform (after)
Please note that this command doesn’t rotate the parts – it simply moves them. Therefore, we shall 
always set their printing orientation first. So, let’s find a couple of ways of changing the part orientation.
Minimize Build Height
The first and most simple command to orientate a part onto the build platform is called Minimize 
Build Height . It is a positioning command whose aim is to reduce the overall Z dimension of the 
printed part.
Orienting the model onto the build platform
 373
Let’s see its behavior with the example part:
Figure 16.11: Minimize Build Height (before)
This is a rather simple  command with just two options:
• Components : This lets us choose the part we want to rotate to minimize the build height.
• Platform clearance : This is a height value offset that raises the bottom face of the part above 
the build platform. Since the first layer is always touching the build platform 99.9% of the time, 
we can leave this field set to 0.00mm .
Printing Our First Part 374
Let’s see the resulting orientation after using this command:
Figure 16.12: Minimize Build Height (after)
Fusion 360 calculated  the best orientation to minimize the Z height of the printed part and rotated 
the component by 45°. Still, this is not an optimized orientation to print our part since this placement 
requires a lot of support material.
We should have more control over part placement. For that, we can use a much more advanced 
command called Automatic Orientation .
Automatic Orientation
Automatic Orientation  is an operation similar to sheet metal nesting. It is a recursive operation that 
aims to optimize part placement in the build volume:
Figure 16.13: Automatic Orientation’s Parameters tab
Orienting the model onto the build platform
 375
Automatic Orientation  is quite a simple yet very powerful command, consisting of two tabs: 
Parameters  and Ranking .
Parameters
Inside the Parameters  tab, we can find a list of basic requirements for the part placement:
• Target Component : Using this selection tool, we can pick the 3D model we want to orient 
onto the build platform.
• Support Overhang Angle : This is the maximum undercut angle at which our 3D printer 
can print a sloped wall. This value is influenced by layer height, printed material, and nozzle 
diameter. However, most of the time, we can consider a maximum value of 40-45°. Therefore, 
we can leave the default setting at 40°.
Note
In 3D printing, sometimes, undercuts are  referred to as overhangs . The meaning is the same: 
it’s an area that is not supported by lower layers.
• Support Bottom Surface : This lets us specify that we want to support the first layer of material. 
This is quite odd since the build platform is always the best support surface available: we don’t 
need support material if it is possible to let the part directly touch the build surface. Most of 
the time, we shall leave this box unticked.
• Smallest Rotation : This is the rotation angle step that will be used to find the optimal placement 
on the build platform. Much like when nesting a sheet metal part, smaller values will lead to a 
better solution but also a longer processing time. Most of the time, we can use a step angle of 
90°. However, for complex parts, we may have to reduce this value by a few degrees. Since the 
example part is very simple, we can go for 90° or for 45°.
• Rotation Axis : This is the axis that’s used to calculate the best part orientation. We shall always 
leave this value set to Arbitrary .
Now that have looked at the first tab, we can move on to the next one.
Ranking
Now that we’ve  specified how the part can be rotated onto the build platform, Fusion 360 can start 
rotating the part until it finds the best orientation. However, we must still tell Fusion 360 how to 
recognize the best part placement. This can be achieved in the Ranking  tab:Printing Our First Part 376
Figure 16.14: Automatic Orientation’s Ranking tab
There are five different optimization targets here. Most of the time, we are going to use the default 
settings, but it is worth mentioning their meaning:
• Support Volume : This evaluates the amount of support material needed to print the part. A 
placement with no support material will reach a higher score, while a placement that requires 
tons of support material will get a lower rank. This is the most important target, so by default, 
it has a Ver y high  value.
• Support Area : This measures the build area used by support structures. A larger area will lead 
to a lower score, while a smaller area will lead to a higher one. Most of the time, this is not an 
interesting parameter since we mostly care about support volume. Therefore, by default, this 
ranking is Not used .
• Bounding Box Volume : This evaluates the overall dimension of the bounding box that contains 
the part along the x, y, and z axes. Once again, this is not a useful ranking value, so by default, 
it is set to Ver y low .
• Part Height : This target gives a higher score to placements that orientate the part in a manner 
that reduces the print height. For example, a tall box will have a higher score when laid on its 
sides rather than standing up. This is quite an important ranking since a taller part may be 
influenced more by vibrations and thermal distortions (as we will discover in Chapter 17 ). By 
default, it has a value of Medium .
• Center of Gravity Height : This gives a higher score to part placements with a center of mass 
closer to the build platform and a lower score to placements with a higher center of mass. This 
setting has a default value of Medium .
Orienting the model onto the build platform
 377
I know that the Automatic Orientation  command may sound a bit complex, but let’s recap its intended 
usage. First, we specified how the part can be rotated onto the build platform, the maximum overhang 
angle that doesn’t need support structures, and the angle step to find the best orientation.
Then, we specified  a set of rankings that will let Fusion 360 decide which is the best part placement. 
In our case, part placements will be ranked mostly by support material usage.
Fusion 360 will then judge the part placement that uses the least amount of support material and will 
propose that placement as the best solution.
Let’s check the results:
Figure 16.15: Automatic Orientation – Rank 1
After running the command, you may have noticed that a new tab called Results  appeared. Here, we 
can find all the rotation steps that Fusion 360 performed to find the best part placement.
From the Rank  drop-down menu, we can select every resulting orientation sorted by the rank result.
For now, we can look at Rank 1 , meaning that the placement displayed in the preceding figure is the 
best one according to Fusion 360, with a Support Volume  of 3730 mm3.
Let’s look at some other  ranks. Rank 2  is the part orientation I plan to use for the printing setup; it 
requires a slightly higher amount of support material ( 3854 mm3) than the previous case, but I think 
it’s much easier to print (both are good options anyway):
Printing Our First Part 378
Figure 16.16: Automatic Orientation – Rank 2
Let’s also check a much lower rank, Rank 7 :
Figure 16.17: Automatic Orientation – Rank 7
This is one of the multiple rotation steps that Fusion 360 evaluated as a possible part placement. It’s 
easy to see why it has such a low ranking:
• It has a very small contact area with the build surface
• It uses more than double the amount of support material used by Rank 1 and Rank 2
• It has a significantly higher center of mass
• It requires a much taller print
Generating the support structures
 379
Please note that automatic part orientation doesn’t consider the ease of printability or the mechanical 
properties of the resulting object. That’s why we sometimes have to go for a lower-ranking placement.
Now that we’ve studied part placement, we can move on with the printing setup and dive into 
support structures.
Generating the support structures
Two commands generate  support structures in Fusion 360, and they can both be found in the SUPPORTS  
dropdown menu under the ADDITIVE  tab. The first and most common support command is called 
Solid Volume Support , while the second is Solid Bar Support :
Figure 16.18: SUPPORTS commands
Straight off the bat, I can tell you that Solid Bar Support  has very poor performance on most FDM 
printers (it is widely used for SLA printers instead). Since SLA printers have limited support in Fusion 
360 and since we are printing an FDM part, we will focus on Solid Volume Support  only. Once 
launched, you’ll see this panel:
Figure 16.19: Solid Volume’s Geometry tab
Printing Our First Part 380
This command is not complex to use, with just two tabs. Let’s look at the first one – the Geometry  tab:
• Supported Model : Using this selection tool, we can specify the 3D model we want to create 
support material for.
• Support Overhang Angle : This is the maximum overhang angle that doesn’t need support 
structures. This value is influenced by layer height and nozzle diameter. However, most of the 
time, a value of 40° will work just fine.
• Avoid : This option lets us specify geometries (faces or parts) that we don’t want to be supported 
by any material. For our example, we can untick this option as there aren’t any structures to avoid.
• Distance to Other Support : This is the minimum distance that new support structures can 
be from other existing support structures. Once again, we can safely untick this option for the 
example model.
Note
Support structures created with FDM printers may be difficult to remove once the print is 
complete. This is especially true if they are very dense and near fragile geometries. That’s why 
we sometimes have to limit their generation. We will learn how to manage support generation 
in more detail in Chapter 17 .
Now, let’s move on to the General  tab:
Figure 16.20: Solid Volume’s General tab
Top Distance to Part  and Bottom Distance to Part  are two similar parameters and are used to reduce 
the bond between the support structures and the printed part.
They reduce the bond strength by adding a small gap between the support material and the printed 
geometry. This way, once the print is complete, it is easier to remove the support material:
Generating the support structures
 381
Figure 16.21: Support distance to part
These gaps depend on the layer height and the printing material. We may have to fine-tune them on our 
printer via some trial and error. The default value of 0.3 mm  will likely work just fine in most scenarios.
Now that we’ve reviewed how to create support structures, we can check the resulting model:
Figure 16.22: Generated support structures
The blue geometries are the generated support structures. Through a preliminary check, we can see 
that we don’t have any unsupported overhang geometries anymore!
And that’s all we need to know about support material generation. We can now move forward and 
check the generated toolpath!
Printing Our First Part 382
Simulating the toolpath
At the moment, our screen should look a bit like this:
Figure 16.23: Printing environment
The 3D printer (and its printing volume) have been set ( 1), the printing settings have been selected 
(2), the part has been properly oriented onto the build platform ( 3), and the support structures are 
up to date ( 4).
However, there is still a warning for the Additive Toolpath  area ( 5) – the yellow triangle on the left  
means that the toolpath data is outdated.
Luckily, updating the toolpath is very simple. To do this, we just need to click the Generate  command, 
which we can find in the ADDITIVE  tab under the ACTIONS  drop-down menu:
Figure 16.24: The Generate command
Simulating the toolpath
 383
After updating the toolpath, we can check the simulation results using the Simulate Additive 
To olp ath  command:
Figure 16.25: Simulated toolpath
The simulation  environment is quite similar to those found for milling and turning – there is a timeline 
at the bottom and a set of play, stop, and rewind buttons to control the simulation’s progress.
Y ou may have noticed a vertical arrow. This allows you to analyze the printed part layer by layer. This 
way, it is possible to check the infill layers or the support material section to find any potential issues 
for surface finish or part strength. Let’s look at a typical example where checking the simulated toolpath 
can prevent us from printing a weak geometry:
Figure 16.26: Simulated toolpath – layer 23
Printing Our First Part 384
Here, we can  find Layer 23  and the infill pattern generated. I think that the resulting strength of the 
part may be a bit weak, so we may need to increase the infill percentage by tweaking the printing 
settings. This is exactly what we are going to do in the next chapter.
For now, let’s suppose we are fine with the current results, and we want to export the file to our 3D 
printer. As we may remember from what we learned for milling and turning, to convert CAM operations 
into G-code, we need to use a post-processor.
Using the post-processor
Now that we have  completed the setup process and simulated the printing process, we can safely 
generate the G-code for our 3D printer via a post-processor.
As you may recall, a post-processor is a program whose scope is translating CAM operations into 
G-code files. Fusion 360 has quite a large set of post-processors for most of the desktop 3D printers 
on the market.
Let’s start the command. Y ou can find the Post Process  command in the ADDITIVE  tab under the 
ACTIONS  drop-down menu:
Figure 16.27: The Post Process command
Using the post-processor
 385
This will launch the following Post Process  window:
Figure 16.28: The Post Process window
The only option we will care about here is the machine model. We can browse all supported 3D printers 
from the Machine  drop-down menu (I picked Flashforge Dreamer ).
If our printer is  supported by Fusion 360, there is not much else we have to do here as the default 
settings will work just fine; we just have to click on Post  and export the generated G-code file to the 
3D printer.
Note
If your 3D printer is not supported by Fusion 360, there is no easy workaround. My only 
suggestion is to find a post-processor (for another printer) that is fairly compatible with your 
printer as well. Then, you can start exporting the same toolpath with several post-processors 
and try to print the generated G-code files. Chances are high that, between all those files, one 
of them will work just fine.
That’s all we need to know to start using Fusion 360 for basic FDM printing processes.
Printing Our First Part 386
Summary
Congratulations – you’ve reached the end of this chapter!
Let’s recap what we went through. First, we presented a real case part to use as a printing example. 
Then, we learned how to create a printing setup inside Fusion 360 and how to set the printing volume 
by picking our 3D printer from the machine library.
After this, we covered several commands that let us position the parts onto the build platform in 
the best way possible. Then, we learned how to generate support structures and how to simulate the 
generated toolpath.
Lastly, we learned how to generate the G-code to send to the 3D printer.
All these steps represent the typical approach to any FDM printing process and are the starting point 
for more advanced operations.
In the next chapter, we are going to dive deeper into advanced printing settings to acquire even more 
tools for complex parts.17
Understanding Advanced 
Printing Settings
Most of the time, the default print settings are more than enough to get good results for our objects. 
However, sometimes, for example, when printing exotic materials or when experimenting with complex 
parts, we may have to tune them a little.
Unfortunately, additive manufacturing is a rather complex process, and FDM printers have a lot of 
settings we must at least understand in order to master the technology.
In this chapter, we will dive straight into printing settings, reviewing the most important ones that 
every beginner should learn. The goal is to show, as much as possible, how different settings can 
influence the printing results.
So, in this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
• Creating a new printing preset
• Understanding general parameters
• Understanding extruder parameters
• Understanding shell parameters
• Understanding infill parameters
• Understanding print bed adhesion
• Understanding support material parameters
• Understanding speed parameters
• Understanding tessellation parametersUnderstanding Advanced Printing Settings 388
Technical requirements
We are about to cover many settings related to the entire FDM printing process. Therefore, as you 
can guess, this is quite an advanced chapter; having read Chapters 14 , 15, and 16 is a mandatory 
starting point.
Creating a new printing preset
All the options we are about to cover can be accessed when editing the printing profile assigned to an 
additive manufacturing setup. To reach the options, we just have to expand Setup1 , under the design 
tree, and right-click on the printing profile, which in the example is called ABS 1.75mm .
Figure 17.1: Printing profile
In the menu, click on Edit  to access all the printing settings contained inside Print Setting Editor :
Creating a new printing preset
 389
Figure 17.2: Print Setting Editor
On the left, we  can find all the printing presets for the selected material (in our case, ABS 1.75mm ). 
At the moment, there are two built-in printing presets – Normal  and Strong . The main difference 
between the two is the density of the material interior and other minor details, such as the number 
of perimeters and the number of top and bottom layers.
We can duplicate a default preset to create a custom printing profile. To do this, we just have to right-
click on an existing profile and select Duplicate :
Figure 17.3: Duplicating profiles
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 390
After duplicating an  existing profile, we can give it a preset name and a preset description. Here, we 
shall type something that may help us in the future to remember what changes were made to the 
default set of parameters.
Figure 17.4: Custom profile
Now that we have created a custom printing preset, we can focus on its parameters and their influence 
on the printing process.
Please note that every section in this chapter will refer to the panels found in Figure 17.2  on the left, 
just below Body Presets .
Understanding general parameters
In this section, we will review the  general parameters found in the General  tab that you can see in 
Figure 17.2 . The options are divided into three categories:
• Global Settings
• Nozzle Priming Settings
• Additional G-Code Settings
Understanding general parameters
 391
The most important settings are contained inside the Global Settings  section, while the Nozzle 
Priming Settings  and Additional G-Code Settings  options are way too advanced for beginners.
Let’s look at the most important Global Settings  options we have to learn (as a rule of thumb, we 
shouldn’t mess with parameters unless we are absolutely confident of their usage, as they can ruin 
our prints):
• Filament Diameter (mm) : This is the diameter of our 3D printing filament. Most 3D printers 
on the market today extrude filaments with a diameter of 1.75 mm or 3 mm. If we want to be 
sure about the diameter, we can measure the filament using a caliper on multiple points. After 
measuring the filament, we may discover that it is a bit bigger or smaller than the nominal 
value, so we can now insert the proper size; for example, the size may be something such as 
1.73 mm or 1.78 mm.
• Print Bed Temperature (Temp C) : This value is the temperature of the 3D printer’s heated 
bed, which has to be set following the specifications provided by the filament’s manufacturer. 
Depending on the type of material, we may need to disable the heated bed or increase its 
temperature up to 120°C. For example, most ABS filaments require a heated bed at around 
105-110°C. We should set the temperature accordingly.
• Layer Height (mm) : This parameter is the height of every printed layer; smaller layers ensure a 
higher resolution and a smoother surface quality, at the cost of higher print times. The typical 
layer height largely depends on the nozzle diameter; however, since a nozzle of 0.4 mm is 
almost a standard for every printer on the market, we can set Layer Height  of 0.1 mm for a 
nice smooth surface finish, up to 0.3 mm for a coarse surface finish. In the following figure, we 
can see the finish difference between a very thin layer and a thicker one.
Figure 17.5: Layer Height
Here, the sphere on the left has a much thinner layer height, while the sphere on the right is 
much coarser. Please note that on most printers, decreasing Layer Height  to below 0.1 mm will 
not give better results; that’s why 0.1 mm is somewhat of a lower limit to the layer thickness.
• Layer 1 Height (mm) : This is the  height of the first layer printed on the build platform. Most 
of the time, it is suggested to increase this thickness to improve layer adhesion to the platform 
and to prevent the nozzle from rubbing against the heated bed.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 392
• Travel Speed (mm/s) : This is the travel speed of the extruder when not printing. It largely 
depends on your machine, including how fast it can move and how much it vibrates.
• Spiral Vase Mode : Long story short, enabling this option will force the extruder to print only 
the outer contour of our part in a long spiral. To get a better idea of the effect, let’s check the 
following example:
Figure 17.6: Spiral Vase Mode
On the left, there is a conventional printing toolpath, while on the right, Spiral Vase Mode  was turned 
on; as we can see in the figure, the cylinder is now hollow and only the outer contour has been printed.
That was all we had to know about the general printing settings. Let’s focus on the next set of parameters 
related to the extruder.
Understanding extruder parameters
In this section, we will review all the  parameters related to the extruder, its temperature, and its 
behavior when printing:
Understanding extruder parameters
 393
Figure 17.7: Extrusion panel
The options are divided into  two main categories:
• Extrusion : A list of settings that control the extrusion width of every extruder
• Extruder # : A list of options to control each extruder, independently controlling parameters 
such as temperature and extrusion flow
Let’s take a look at these in more detail.
Extrusion options
The following parameters are mostly related to the dimension of the nozzle and are rarely changed:
• Part Extruder : When using a multi-extruder printer, this selection panel can specify which 
extruder shall be used to print the part geometries.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 394
• All the options from Extrusion Width (mm)  up to Bridge Extrusion Width (mm) : These values 
are used to determine the width of the toolpath. As a best practice for most applications, the 
extrusion width can be set to a range between 100% and 200% of the size of the nozzle diameter.
So, for example, if our printer has a nozzle with a diameter of 0.4 mm, we can set an extrusion 
width from 0.4 mm up to 0.8 mm.
Figure 17.8: Extrusion Width
Please note that Layer Height  is equal in both examples of the preceding figure, but on the left, since 
the line width is smaller, lower printing widths result in a better surface finish (this is especially true 
for complex geometries) and better overall precision.
On the other hand, higher extrusion widths ensure lower printing times and stronger layer adhesion.
Note
Why does a higher extrusion width decrease printing times? The reason is simple: since the 
lines are wider, they can cover the same area with a smaller number of passes!
There is no magic rule to set the extrusion width – my suggestion is to start using a width equal to 
the nozzle diameter and change the values if needed.
Extruder 1 options
The following parameters are related to the printing material extruded by Extruder 1 , but it is possible 
to adjust printing settings individually for each extruder if needed:
• Extrusion Flow (%) : This is a multiplier that overrides the amount of material extruded. We 
may have to adjust this parameter if the width of a printed line is different than expected.
As you can see in the following figure, when increasing the flow, there is more material extruded 
through the nozzle than needed; therefore, the resulting printing width will be higher:
Understanding shell parameters
 395
Figure 17.9: Extrusion Flow multiplier
Since this higher amount of material creates overlapping areas between the passes, increasing 
the material flow grants a higher layer strength. In contrast, decreasing the flow will create 
gaps between the extruded lines since there is not enough material to fill the space. Ideally, 
we should tweak this parameter only if the nominal extrusion width is different from reality.
• Extruder Temperature (Temp C) : This is one of the most important parameters to keep in 
mind – it is the softening point of our printed polymer. Every material has a different extruding 
temperature, so we shall always refer to the temperature suggested by the polymer supplier; for 
example, PLA may be extruded at around 180°C while ABS has to be extruded at around 220°C.
Extruding a polymer at the wrong temperature will likely clog the extruder or result in  
a bad-quality print – we must always check the temperatures!
• Standby Temperature (Temp C) : This is a parameter mostly used for multi-extruder printers. 
It is the temperature of the extruders that are not printing; once these extruders have to start 
printing, they will be heated up to the extruding temperature and then start printing.
• Retract Length (mm) : This value measures how much the filament shall be retracted when 
the extruder is not printing. Higher values are needed for very soft materials, while smaller 
values can be used for denser materials.
• Retract Speed (mm/s) : This parameter measures how fast the filament is retracted when the 
extruder is not printing. Smaller values should be used for stiffer materials, while higher ones 
should be used for softer materials.
Those were the most important options to master the extrusion parameters; we can now move on to 
the next section, where we will learn about printed geometries.
Understanding shell parameters
In this section, we will review all the options that let us control the outer geometries of our part. This 
is very important since they affect what you can actually see once the part is printed.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 396
As we can see in the following figure, there are three different types of outer geometries to consider:
Figure 17.10: Shell surfaces
The options we are about to cover handle all these different surfaces:
Figure 17.11: Shell panel
Understanding shell parameters
 397
Let’s break down the options:
• Number of Perimeters : This is the number of perimeters to be printed in the outer contour. As 
you can imagine, more perimeters take longer to be printed but they also help create a stronger 
part (this is especially true for complex shapes).
Figure 17.12: Outer perimeters
On the left of the preceding figure, we can see a rather typical print with two perimeters, while 
on the right, we have a pretty sturdy print with six outer perimeters for a very tough part. Most 
of the time, we can go for two to three perimeters only. A much more effective way of increasing 
the part strength is increasing the density of the infill geometry. We will discover how to do 
just that in the next section.
• Number of Top Layers : This is the  number of layers to be printed on top of the part. We will 
increase the number of top layers especially if the infill density is low. This can be a bit tricky 
to understand, so let’s take a look at the following example:
Figure 17.13: Top layer infill
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 398
The figure displays two parts – both feature a very low infill density; however, the part on the 
left features only two top layers, while the part on the right has five of them. As we can see, the 
extruder had problems when printing the top layers of both parts: the material is not supported 
enough. But the part on the right still has a good top surface finish since the last layer could 
be printed on the adjacent top layers previously printed.
• Number of Bottom Layers : This is the number of bottom layers printed. We should always 
print at least two or three bottom layers; otherwise, the part will likely get damaged while 
detaching it from the build platform.
• Randomize Z- Seam Alignment : This option controls the location around the perimeter of 
the part where the extruder will start and end. This is important because typically, the starting 
point of each layer has tiny defects:
Figure 17.14: Randomize Z-Seam Alignment
The light dots on the parts display the starting points for every layer; in those locations, it is likely 
to have a tiny bump if the printing settings are not properly set. On the left of the preceding 
figure, we can see the default behavior of Fusion 360, where every entry point is aligned, and on 
the right, we have enabled Randomize Z-Seam Alignment , which evenly distributes the dots 
around the part. Please note that random entry and exit points can also help with increasing 
the part's strength.
• Perimeter Overlap Ratio : This option lets us specify how much each perimeter should overlap 
with another. High overlap values ensure a stronger part at the expense of worse precision and 
surface quality.
Now that we have a clear idea of what is going on with the outer surfaces of the print, we can focus 
on the inner structures.
Understanding infill parameters
In this section, we  will cover all the options to manage the inner areas of our part – in particular, the 
infill geometries and their specifications:
Understanding infill parameters
 399
Figure 17.15: Infill panel
Let’s look at the options:
• Infill Density (%) : This is the  amount of infill material printed. A value of 100% will result 
in a solid part, while a value of 0% is an empty shell. Usually, this value is set around 30%, 
depending on the loads applied on the part.
As we can see in the following figure, changing the infill density can drastically change the part 
weight and strength as well as the printing time:
Figure 17.16: Infill percentage
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 400
The part on the right features infill geometries with a density of 10%, while the part on the left 
has an infill density of just 20%. This means that the inner structures of the part on the left are 
twice as strong, but also twice as heavy and take twice as long to print.
• Infill Pattern : This is the shape of the infill material. There are multiple geometries to choose 
from; this includes Gyroid , Honeycomb , and Squares , which are very popular with users:
Figure 17.17: Gyroid versus Squares infill
On the left, we can see an example of the Gyroid  infill, while on the right, we can see the Squares  
infill. My suggestion is to choose an infill pattern that avoids sharp turns when printing the 
structures, as this will greatly reduce vibration due to sudden speed changes… that’s why I love 
the Gyroid  infill pattern so much!
• Perimeter-Infill Overlap Ratio : This value specifies how much the infill geometries should 
overlap the layer perimeter. Higher overlapping values will result in a stronger part, but also 
in a worse surface finish with less precision.
That’s all we need to know about infill patterns – there are some minor options that we left out, but to 
tell you the truth, it is very rare to deal with them; therefore, we can forget about them.
Now that we have looked at all the most important options to master infill geometries, we can move 
on to another hot topic: bed adhesion.
Understanding print bed adhesion
I was unsure whether to include this section or not, as it is a bit advanced for a beginner who wants to 
jump straight into printing, but on the other hand, it can be a lifesaver for many real-world scenarios.
The core of this section is how to improve the bond between the print bed and our part. As you may 
expect, if the printed part partially or fully detaches from the build platform while being printed, it 
becomes garbage in no time.
Understanding print bed adhesion
 401
Y ou may be wondering what may cause part detachments. The reason is pretty simple: thermal 
expansion (or shrinkage)! That’s why we have to understand the temperature distributions inside a 
printed part a bit better.
Thermal expansion and shrinkage
There is a key concept behind all the options we are about to discuss: every material on the planet 
shrinks and expands when cooling or heating occurs.
When printing a part, we never have a  constant temperature on our part:
Figure 17.18: Temperature profile
As we can see here, there are two main sources of heat: the heated build plate and the extruding 
nozzle. The extruder has a temperature of 220°C, while the heated bed has a temperature of 110°C. 
This is a delta of 110°C.
To make things  even worse, the layers in the middle of a tall part are quite far from both the extruder 
and the build plate; therefore, they will cool down almost to room temperature (if our printer doesn’t 
feature an insulated build chamber).
A temperature differential of 190°C is prone to create temperature tensions between the layers. The 
different  shrinking ratios of different layers can cause cracks and detachments from the build platform.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 402
The typical issue found when printing materials such as ABS is corners detaching from the build plate:
Figure 17.19: Corner detachment
If our prints feature an issue similar to the one shown in the preceding figure, we most likely have a 
problem with temperatures and cooling.
This was a long prelude to introduce a specific set of options that can handle this type of issue. Let’s 
start dealing with them.
Print bed adhesion
There are three different techniques related to print adhesion that Fusion 360 offers:
Figure 17.20: Print Bed Adhesion
Understanding print bed adhesion
 403
These techniques are as follows:
• Skirt
• Brim
• Raft
Don’t worry, we don’t have to study all of them. First of all, I’ d like to point out that Skirt  shouldn’t be 
included in this section since it is not a way to improve bed adhesion; it is rather a priming technique 
for the extruder. Therefore, we won’t cover this option.  Raft , on the other hand, is quite an advanced 
adhesion technique that, most of the time, is a bit overkill for common parts; therefore, we won’t 
cover it either.
So, let’s look at the remaining option, Brim , which is the most commonly used technique and easy 
to understand.
Brim  is a way of printing a certain number of perimeters around the first layer; this additional material 
will increase the adhesion of the first layer to the platform.
Figure 17.21: Brim
In this example, the part on the left has Print Bed Adhesion type  set to Brim ; therefore, as we can 
immediately spot, it has a large number of perimeters printed around the bottom layer. This technique 
is particularly useful if the bottom layer has many sharp corners.
Let’s now focus on the main options to control Brim :
• Number of Brim Layers : With this option, we can specify how thick the brim support should 
be. 99% of the time, we can leave this value at 1.
• Number of Brim Loops : This option lets us specify how many perimeters we want to print 
around the first layer. This number depends on part complexity. Most of the time, we can get 
successful prints with 3-5 contours.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 404
As always, we shall take every option with a grain of salt and ask ourselves what the best printing 
strategy for the given geometry is.
For example, in the preceding figure, we can see two very simple geometries without sharp corners on 
the first layer. Therefore, unless we want to print with exotic materials with a crazy-high temperature 
expansion coefficient, we can most likely disable brim generation and go for the print shown on the 
right without any additional adhesion geometries.
That was all a beginner must know about adhesion techniques; it is now time to move on to looking 
at support material!
Understanding support material parameters
In this section, we are going to study the most important parameters related to support material and 
its shape:
Figure 17.22: Support panel
Understanding speed parameters
 405
Let’s look at the options:
• Support Extruder : Using this option, we can specify which extruder shall print the support 
structures. This only applies if our printer has more than one extruder.
• Support Infill Density : The name is self-explanatory – this parameter is the density of the 
generated support structures. A higher density means a larger contact area with the part and 
stronger support.
Figure 17.23: Support density
In the  preceding figure, we can see a rather complex part being printed with support structures: on 
the left, we can see a support density of 15%, while on the right, the density is 50%. As we can guess, 
the part on the right will greatly benefit from the higher support density for all overhang geometries.
Now that we have reviewed the most important settings to generate support structures, we can move 
on to the next section, where we will discover speed and acceleration parameters.
Understanding speed parameters
In this section, we will cover the most  important parameters that control printing movements. This set 
of parameters is really important to understand and manage since wrong values can lead to vibrations 
and motor overheating, to name just a couple of typical issues.
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 406
As we can see in the following figure, there are many values we can set inside the Speed  panel:
Figure 17.24: Speed panel
Please note that I cannot give you a startup value for all these parameters, since they are highly 
dependent on the machine’s performance; sturdier and more powerful machines can print much faster 
than entry-level ones. My suggestion is to check the default speed values supplied by your machine 
brand and stick to them.
The key idea behind this set of parameters is to set movement limitations on our machine, a bit like 
the speed limits we find on the roads every day. Even if our machine can move much faster, these 
parameters are intended to preserve machine life and improve print quality.
As we are about to  discover, not only can we control speed, but we also have much greater control 
over the printing movements. Let’s review the options in detail.
Understanding speed parameters
 407
Speed
Speed control is very intuitive. With the following parameters, we can control how fast the 3D printer 
should move while working:
• External Perimeter Speed (mm/s) : This is the printing speed used by the extruder when 
printing the outermost contour. Since this contour determines the surface finish of the part, it 
is always suggested to reduce the printing speed as much as possible.
• Internal Perimeter Speed (mm/s) : This is the printing speed for all the other perimeters. Since 
these geometries are inside the part (and cannot be seen), it is possible to print them a bit faster 
than the outermost perimeters.
• Infill Speed (mm/s) : This is the printing speed for the infill geometries. Usually, since the infill 
pattern is quite simple and it is hidden inside the part, we can use, as the infill speed, the highest 
printing speed achievable by our machine when extruding the chosen material. Increasing the 
infill speed as much as possible can drastically reduce the overall printing time.
• Layer 1 Speed Multiplier : As we found out when talking about bed adhesion, the first layer is 
always the most important: we must guarantee perfect adhesion to the build platform. That’s 
why, in order to have better stickiness, it is always recommended to reduce the printing speed 
as much as possible. Modifying this parameter, we can set a percentage of reduction from the 
default printing speed. A common speed multiplier for the first layer is 0.3 to 0.5.
• Top and Bottom Infill Speed (mm/s) : This is the printing speed for the first and last layers. 
Printing at reduced speeds can improve bed adhesion and the overall surface quality – that’s 
why, most of the time, we use the same speed as used for the outermost perimeters.
• Support Speed (mm/s) : This is the printing speed when printing the support structures. Since 
the support pattern is always very simple, and since it is also disposable, we shall always print 
these structures as fast as possible with our machine.
Acceleration
Up to this point, we’ve discussed the most important speed values to set; however, advanced printers 
can also control accelerations.
What is acceleration ? If speed is how fast an object is moving, acceleration is how fast its speed is 
changing, and it is measured in mm/s2.
Let’s review the parameters related to acceleration:
• Acceleration : Flagging this option will set a command inside the generated G-code file to 
manage the acceleration of the 3D printer. However, please note that not every 3D printer can 
control accelerations via G-code.Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 408
• Travel Acceleration : This is the maximum acceleration for rapid movements. A higher 
acceleration ensures a more responsive machine and faster prints; however, we may want to 
reduce the maximum acceleration a little bit in order to reduce vibrations and resonances. Also, 
the value must be equal to or lower than the maximum acceleration reachable by our printer, 
to fit within its mechanical limits.
• Print Acceleration : This is the  maximum acceleration for printing movements.
Jerk
What is jerk? Basically, it  is how fast the printer’s acceleration changes, measured in mm/s3.
Since not every machine  is capable of controlling jerk, we should definitely check the specifications 
of our printer if we plan to use it.
Let’s check the options available to control jerk:
• Jerk: This option enables jerk control.
• Print Jerk : This is the maximum jerk reached by our machine while printing. Higher values 
will reduce printing time at the cost of more vibrations and resonances. If while printing we 
discover our machine is vibrating too much, we should decrease the jerk and acceleration values.
That was all we need to know about machine movements – please note that we just scratched the 
surface of motion control, but this is more than enough for most uses.
Before moving forward, I’ d like to highlight that, up until now, we’ve discussed very common 
parameters found in every slicing  software, such as Cura or Simplify3D (just to name a couple of 
valuable alternatives to Fusion 360).
However, since Fusion 360 is CAD software, we can also manage tessellation options – that’s what we 
will discover in the next section.
Note
Slicing software is responsible for cutting a 3D model and converting it into a set of tiny slices 
that are then handled by a 3D printer.
Understanding tessellation parameters
First of all, what is tessellation ? Tessellation is a process where 3D CAD models are converted into 
3D mesh models. This conversion is needed for 3D printing in order to calculate toolpaths.
In the following figure, on the left, we have a solid CAD model where the circle profiles are perfectly 
rounded, and on the right, we converted the model into a mesh via tessellation:Understanding tessellation parameters
 409
Figure 17.25: CAD geometry versus mesh geometry
The main difference between these two types of 3D geometries is how they are defined; CAD models 
are based on rigorous math equations and they can describe every shape without losing details. Mesh 
models, on the other hand, are based on a finite number of vertices and faces connected by edges.
Long story short, tessellation always loses details in the conversion process; that’s why it is important 
to understand how to set it properly. If the tessellation is too rough, we may end up with unforeseen 
triangles that can ruin the surface finish!
Luckily, there aren’t that many parameters we have to truly understand for tessellation:
Figure 17.26: Tessellation panel
Understanding Advanced Printing Settings 410
Let’s look at the two most  important ones:
• Body Resolution : Inside this drop-down panel, we can pick factory presets for tessellation. 
They are named according to the level of detail – High  is the most detailed tessellation level, 
while Low  is the least detailed.
In the following figure, we can see differences between two cylinders tessellated with the Low  
preset on the left and the High  preset on the right:
Figure 17.27: Tessellation differences
As you can imagine, the object on the left, once printed, won’t look like a cylinder; all those 
edges will be visible on the surface. The object on the right will look much smoother since the 
edges are so short that they won’t be perceived by the naked eye at the first glance.
Most of the time, we can leave the default preset on (which is High ) and it will work just fine. 
However, sometimes we may want to increase the resolution of the generated mesh beyond 
the maximum default preset. If this is the case, we should change the following parameter.
• Maximum Surface Deviation (mm) : This is the maximum possible distance between a CAD 
surface and its corresponding tessellated mesh. Smaller values will lead to a more accurate 
mesh. Please note that higher details also mean a heavier 3D file and a heavier G-code file, so 
check how much data your 3D printer or slicer can handle.
We’ve now covered all the settings a beginner should understand in order to start experimenting with 
their own printing settings. We probably even went beyond an intermediate level on certain topics, 
but I think it was important to mention all these options and parameters.
Summary
 411
Summary
That was the end of the chapter! We covered a lot of information, so let’s recap what we learned.
First of all, we discovered how to create a custom printing preset by duplicating a default preset. Then, 
we went through all the most important options to pay attention to when customizing a printing profile.
We discovered how to set the printing temperature for our material, controlling both the extruder and 
the heated bed, then we found out how to set the layer height, the filament diameter, and an extrusion 
multiplier to adjust the extrusion width.
After these general settings, we analyzed in detail how to control the shell geometries and the infill 
geometries, reviewing most of the available settings.
We also looked at advanced adhesion techniques to avoid issues related to thermal shrinkage and 
temperature differential.
Following this, we went through support material creation and speed and acceleration parameters.
Lastly, we covered the tessellation process and the difference between mesh models and CAD models.
That was quite a valuable list of topics, in my opinion. I hope that all the contents explained up to this 
point will prove useful for your future applications.
Y ou are almost at the end of the book, but I invite you to move on to the next chapter, where we will 
test our knowledge with a simple quiz on all the topics covered up to this chapter.Part 5 –  
Testing Our Knowledge
This is the last part of the book – after learning so much from previous chapters, it is time to test our 
knowledge with a quiz covering the entire content of the book.
This part includes the following chapter:
• Chapter 18 , Quiz18
Quiz
Reading a book where all of the topics are covered and explained can often give you a false sense of 
having understood everything. However, in reality, there are probably things you may not have properly 
grasped and need to revisit. A test, in my opinion, is the best way to expose these gaps.
That’s what we’re going to do now—there are questions on a variety of topics: some are more simple 
and some are more complex. So, let’s see whether we have improved our knowledge of all the subjects 
covered by this book.
Technical requirements
It is strongly recommended to have read all the chapters!
Questions
Turning (from Chapters 1 to 5)
1. In terms of turning, what is the difference between cutting depth and cutting feed?
A. The cutting depth is a measure of how much the tool is plunging inside the stock and it is 
measured in millimeters (mm), while the cutting feed is a measure of how much the tool is 
advancing at every revolution, and therefore it is measured in mm per revolution (mm/rev).
B. The cutting depth is how deep the tool is cutting, measuring its position from the rotation 
axis of the chuck, while the cutting feed is a measure of how fast a tool is plunging radially 
into the stock.
C. The depth of cut is a measure of how much the cutting edge is engaged into the stock, while 
the cutting feed is the tangential velocity measured at the tooltip.Quiz 416

A.   specifies the cutting power needed to cut a certain material, therefore it is measured 
in kilowatts (kW).
B.   is the specific cutting force, measured in Megapascal (MPa), and is a value representing 
how easily a certain material can be cut.
C.   is a dimensionless safety factor used in equations that considers power losses due 
to friction.
3. How does the nose radius of a turning tool affect the surface finish?

C. It is a built-in library of tools that Fusion 360 is based on.Quiz 418
13. What is a potential cause of troubles for facing operations?
A. Facing operations are risky since the tool is cutting very close to the chuck, therefore 
collisions may occur if the Safe-Z plane is not set properly.
B. Facing is a cutting operation where the radial coordinate of the tool can greatly change, 
therefore the spindle speed must be adjusted accordingly. When cutting close to the center, 
we must increase the turning speed.
C. A facing operation requires the tool to cut complex profiles, therefore we must be sure to 
solve any accessibility issues first.
14. Why should we flag the option to reduce feed when performing the final stock cut?
A. A reduced feed allows for a better surface finish.
B. When cutting a part, it gets weaker and weaker the closer the tool arrives to the rotation 
axis. Therefore, reducing the feed when close to the centerline helps in reducing vibrations 
and bending.
C. When cutting a part, chip evacuation is not an issue, therefore we can safely reduce the 
cutting feed for higher productivity.
15. What are rapid movements?
A. Rapid movements are a complex set of movements needed to automatically change the tool.
B. Rapid movements are tool movements performed in the fastest way possible; they are used 
when not cutting the stock to maximize production.
C. Rapid movements allow a faster stock cut. This is done by increasing the speed of the 
machine’s motor over safe levels.
16. What is a postprocessor?
A. It is a CAM software that let us set every cutting operation such as facing, contouring, 
and so on.
B. It is part of the CNC machine that helps the user to manually control the machine.

the screw.
B. We should always know all the thread specifications from standardized tables.
C. We must carefully pick the threads in the right order—smaller threads will always be 
machined first.
19. Why is threading a demanding operation on the tool?
A. Because chip evacuation may become a real problem, especially if the hole is deep and blind.
B. Because if using constant depth-of-cut passes, the cutting edge is engaged more and more, 
increasing the tool load. That’s why advanced CAM operations allow optimized cutting depths.
C. Both A and B are right.
20. Why can we drill holes only on the spinning axis in turning?
A. Because the tools can only be mounted radially.
B. Because there is not a dedicated spindle for the drill bit—the chuck that holds the part in 
place is used for drilling, therefore it is possible to drill only on the rotation axis.
C. Because that would require a custom-made tool.
Milling (from Chapters 6 to 10)
21. What is the difference between table feed and cutting feed?
A. Table feed is how far the table moves after a single spindle revolution, therefore it is measured 
in mm/rev. Cutting feed is how fast the tool plunges into the stock, therefore it is measured 
in mm per second  (mm/sec ).
B. There are multiple feed values in milling. Table feed represents how fast the tool is 
moving forward, measured in mm per minute  (mm/min ). Cutting feed is a proper feed, 
representing measures of how far the tool will move after a single tool revolution and is 
measured in mm/rev.
C. They are the same thing.Quiz 420
22. What is the difference between up milling and down milling?
A. The difference is how the tooth engages the stock. Down milling is always preferred over 
up milling, as the teeth enter where the forming chip is thick. In contrast, with up milling, 
the teeth enter where the forming chip is thin.
B. Down milling, also called conventional milling, means that the tool is plunging into the 
stock axially, moving downward. Up milling is obtained when the tool plunges into the 
stock, moving upward.
C. They are the same thing.
23. Which entering angle would you pick for a high-feed facing operation?
A. A small entering angle such as 15°.
B. The best entering angle for a facing operation is always 90°.
C. It depends on the material to be machined.
24. Which is the best entering angle for shoulder milling and face milling?
A. Shoulder milling requires an entering angle of 15°, while face milling requires an entering 
angle of 90°—these operations cannot be performed by the same tool!
B. A tool with a KAPR angle of 45° is always preferred for both face milling and shoulder milling.
C. Since shoulder milling requires 90° milled faces, we have no choice but to use a 90° 
KAPR angle.
25. What are the advantages of thread milling against taping?
A. Thread milling can be performed both with a lathe and a milling CNC center using the 
same tool.
B. Thread milling allows a single tool to create multiple threads—it is better for chip evacuation 
and it can machine a thread almost until the end of a blind hole.
C. Thread milling can be performed on old machines manually controlling the tool.
26. What is an undercut?
A. It is part of the stock that has to be cut before moving to the next cutting operation.

A. G54 is the default WCS offset.
B. G54 is the position of the default tool slot for tool change.
C. G54 is the typical command that enables rapid movements.
32. Why may we want to use a less-than-optimal milling tool for a facing operation?
A. If the tool is already worn, we may decide to complete its life cycle with a final operation 
before throwing it into the bin.
B. If our machined part features both facing operations and shoulder operations, we may 
prefer to use a single tool for both.Quiz 422
C. Since on most CNC centers we cannot install every tool shape, we may be forced to use a 
less-than-optimal tool.
33. What is important to check alongside the cutting power required for a certain operation?

commands require human intervention.
B. Adaptive commands create a more advanced toolpath capable of delivering a constant load 
on the tool, reducing vibrations and resonances.
C. Adaptive commands can automatically change the tool according to the geometry being 
machined on a single operation; non-adaptive commands can use a single tool per 
operation instead.
35. What is pecking?
A. It is a strong noise caused by part resonances; it can heavily damage the tool and ruin the 
surface finish of the part.
B. It is a chip management strategy for deep holes.
C. It is a custom drill bit featuring coolant channels for deep drilling.
36. Why can we not be sure whether a toolpath is cutting in up or down milling just by looking at it?
A. Because we should also know the cutting-edge placement and the spinning direction of 
the tool.
B. Because we don’t know the entry point and the exit point of the toolpath.
C. Because the toolpath doesn’t show the tool.
37. Why can a ball nose mill cause issues on a three-axis CNC?
A. Because it can only be used on multi-axis machines.
B. A Cartesian milling machine cannot tilt the tool; therefore, when milling flat horizontal 
faces, the cutting speed of the tool on the tip would be 0.
C. Because it requires feeds and powers that only a multi-axis machine can sustain for a 
prolonged time.Questions
 423
38. What should we check when milling a hole with a flute end mill?
A. We must check that both the maximum helix angle and the maximum cutting depth 
requirements are respected.
B. We should check for collisions against the thread’s tooth.
C. A flute mill is a special tool used for threading; therefore, we must understand the thread 
pitch and its diameters.
39. What is roughness,   ?
A. It is a scientific method to evaluate the roughness of a part based on the amount of reflected 
light. The shinier the surface, the more light is reflected. Measuring the reflection intensity 
gives the roughness of the surface.
B. It is the roughness measured along the z axis of the active WCS offset.

thick metal sheets.
C. Nesting is an automatic process to manage the metal sheets’ warehouse. Using nesting, we 
can reduce the amount of metal scrap generated.
45. What is sheet stacking?
A. Sheet stacking means cutting multiple sheets at once stacked together. It is a common 
technique for waterjets; however, it is impossible for lasers since the extreme heat would 
weld the sheets together.
B. Sheet stacking means cutting multiple sheets at once stacked together. It is a common 
technique for lasers and can vastly increase productivity.

A. Tabs are used to perfectly align the metal sheets for stacking.
B. Tabs are interrupted cuts; they are used to let the part cool down and avoid distortions in 
the metal lattice.
C. Tabs are micro joints between the part and the metal sheet; they are needed to prevent 
parts from flipping and exposing the laser head to dangerous impacts.
48. How would you describe the width of a laser cut?
A. Zero—laser cutting generates no chip, in fact.
B. Very small, but has to be considered to get proper tolerances on the parts.
C. Larger on thinner metal sheets.

alcohol, resulting in special waste that is hard to recycle.
B. Y es—most PLA filaments are polymerized by corn; therefore, they are completely recyclable.
C. No—nylon powder is noxious when exposed to the chemical bath to complete its 
polymerization. 
51. Why does selective laser sintering (SLS) have the highest productivity among other 3D 
printing technologies?
A. Because it uses support structures capable of holding multiple parts together.

printing process.
B. Y es—however, extreme undercuts may require additional support structures.
C. Y es—3D printers don’t experiment with undercuts since they print the object layer by layer.
54. Does layer orientation affect the mechanical properties of an FDM-printed part?
A. No—the material is polymerized between the layers, therefore the resulting object is isotropic.
B. Y es, since it may require additional support structures to reinforce the part strength.
C. Y es—the printed part may feature a severe anisotropy perpendicular to the layer orientation.
55. What does material anisotropy mean?
A. We have anisotropies when a material features different mechanical properties along 
different directions.

creates residual tensions inside the structure that weaken the part in certain directions.
C. It's a term used to express the strength of composite materials like carbon fibers.
56. Is a printed part affected by thermal expansion?
A. No—printing processes happen at room temperature; therefore, even if there is a tiny 
thermal expansion, we can safely ignore it.
B. Y es—the printing material is extruded at high temperatures; therefore, when cooling down, 
the part will shrink, which may cause bad dimension tolerances and distortions.
